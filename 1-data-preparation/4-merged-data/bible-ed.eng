And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry
And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, and the LORD was with him
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal
And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit
All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve
to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit
These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office
but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will
So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards
For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ
In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south
For the body is not one member, but many
And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them
If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing
For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God
If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling
And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them
But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him
And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale
And if they were all one member, where were the body
Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices
But now are they many members, yet but one body
And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices
Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary
And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans
and those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness
And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath
that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another
And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that work day and night
Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular
These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal
and his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing
and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing
And Mikloth begat Shimeam
Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up
And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren
rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth
And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul
beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things
And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part
And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died
But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away
So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things
And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity
And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa
Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy
And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people
But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort
And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon
And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped
And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul
For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle
they arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days
There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification
So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it
Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me
and enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse
Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church
Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh
Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret
Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel
For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful
And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land
Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest
And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither
For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified
Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David
I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all
And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain
If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad
So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief
But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all
And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth
And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city
How is it then, brethren
So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him
when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation
These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel
Let all things be done unto edifying
And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties
But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God
And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance
Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge
Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim
If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace
And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Beth-lehem
For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted
And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets
And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three
For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints
Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three
came the word of God out from you
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day
If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord
And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear
But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant
These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties
Let all things be done decently and in order
Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures
Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite
After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles
Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war
And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time
They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin
Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed
The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite
Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead
and Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite
But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen
Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite
and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain
Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites
Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not
and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor
For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised
Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third
and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins
Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth
Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished
Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable
Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth
Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power
Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh
For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet
These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand
The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death
These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west
And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all
And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David
I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily
And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads
Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners
And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host
but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body
For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God
All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds
And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD
it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body
The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war
There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body
Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred
Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual
Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred
The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven
And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred
As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly
and Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's house twenty and two captains
And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly
And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul
For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality
And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers
The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law
And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king
But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment
Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye
Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart
And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me
And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand
Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia
And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred
And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go
And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand
For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit
And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand
But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost
And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them
For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries
Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel
Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do
And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader
As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time
And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong
And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people
Let all your things be done with charity
So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim
I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it
that ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth
And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart
The churches of Asia salute you
And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets
Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house
And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled
All the brethren greet you
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God
Greet ye one another with an holy kiss
And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you
So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite
that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house
And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full
And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters
If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth
Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us
and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet
And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments
And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim
He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now
So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there
I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake
Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world
And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire
If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him
And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley
And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever
Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees
But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things
David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer
Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ
And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations
He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son
And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent
Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning
Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever
If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father
And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it
And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life
And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites
These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you
And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure
and said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law
So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel
He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning
And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD
For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil
And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy
In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother
So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another
and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters
Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you
So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass
We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren
and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth
He that loveth not his brother abideth in death
and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel
But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him
And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful
Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God
And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark
And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight
So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy
And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment
And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams
And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him
And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen
And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us
Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God
And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart
They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them
And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD
He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love
And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him
And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel
Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another
Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals
Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit
Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God
And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world
Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God
Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name,
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us
Make known his deeds among the people
God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him
Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him,
There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment
Talk ye of all his wondrous works
He that feareth is not made perfect in love
Glory ye in his holy name:
We love him, because he first loved us
Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD
And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also
Seek the LORD and his strength,
By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments
Seek his face continually
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God
Remember his marvellous works that he hath done,
And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us
His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth
and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him
O ye seed of Israel his servant,
We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not
Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones
And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness
He is the LORD our God;
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia
His judgments are in all the earth
to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you
Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham,
who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
And of his oath unto Isaac
receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls
And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law,
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ
And to Israel for an everlasting covenant
but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation
When ye were but few,
but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot
Even a few, and strangers in it
All flesh is as grass,
And when they went from nation to nation,
And all the glory of man as the flower of grass
And from one kingdom to another people
The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away
He suffered no man to do them wrong:
Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings
Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes
if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious
Declare his glory among the heathen;
even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed
His marvellous works among all nations
having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation
For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised:
or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well
He also is to be feared above all gods
For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men
For all the gods of the people are idols:
Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward
But the LORD made the heavens
For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully
Glory and honour are in his presence;
For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently
Strength and gladness are in his place
but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God
Fear before him, all the earth:
For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls
The world also shall be stable, that it be not moved
while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof:
Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel
Let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein
For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good;
Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous
For his mercy endureth for ever
Let him eschew evil, and do good;
So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required
Let him seek peace, and ensue it
and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters
And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good
and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon
having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ
to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel
by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison
and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God
that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God
And the sons of Jeduthun were porters
wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you
And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house
who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead
And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying
But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer
for I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another
And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins
Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel
Use hospitality one to another without grudging
and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth
As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God
And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you
He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified
I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David
And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away
And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time
What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant
casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you
for thou knowest thy servant
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour
O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things
To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever
O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears
We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers
And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt
so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia
For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God
For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain
Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said
But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children
For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee
as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children
And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant
Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us
Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines
For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing
And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts
Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming
And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates
For ye are our glory and joy
And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men
therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith
And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem
for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord
Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass
night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith
Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah
Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you
Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek
And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you
Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand
For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus
And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants
that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour
Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went
not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God
So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people
But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another
And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him
And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord
And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me
Wherefore comfort one another with these words
And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father
But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you
So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him
For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night
Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away
But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief
And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men
Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness
And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field
For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night
Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians
Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do
And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon
And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you
And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee
and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake
So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him
And be at peace among yourselves
And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them
Quench not the Spirit
And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them
Despise not prophesyings
So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him
Prove all things; hold fast that which is good
But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host
Abstain from all appearance of evil
And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city
Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it
And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes
Brethren, pray for us
Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon
Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss
And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned
But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him
But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully
And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel
for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine
And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David
I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men
And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword
for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty
But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab
who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth
And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel
I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting
And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection
either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel
For Adam was first formed, then Eve
Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression
So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men
one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity
And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD
Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil
And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground
Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre
So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight
holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience
And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering
For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus
And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof
These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly
At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils
For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon
For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving
But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD
for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer
And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained
And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation
also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David
For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe
Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel
These things command and teach
And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God
Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine
but the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight
the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity
Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee
Honour widows that are widows indeed
Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God
But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth
Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work
But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry
David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying
having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith
So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel
And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not
And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites
I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully
Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand
For some are already turned aside after Satan
moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith
Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine
And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari
Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear
And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house
Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities
Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi
Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed
The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer
But godliness with contentment is great gain
And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them
And having food and raiment let us be therewith content
These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward
But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition
For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever
that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate
and also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life
For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia
because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God
grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ
both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size
Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort
and to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ
and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD
ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf
and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD
And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit
But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office
who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts
And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service
But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness
Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar
Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many
And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar
So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow
These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him
Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him
These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren
For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things
Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD
To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ
Of Heman: the sons of Heman; Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth
lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices
all these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn
Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place
And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters
For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish
So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight
And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward
the third to Zaccur, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious
the fourth to Izri, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory
the fifth to Nethaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth
the sixth to Bukkiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech
the seventh to Jesharelah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart
the eighth to Jeshaiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away
the ninth to Mattaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost
the tenth to Shimei, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed
the eleventh to Azareel, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body
the twelfth to Hashabiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh
the thirteenth to Shubael, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
So then death worketh in us, but life in you
the fourteenth to Mattithiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God
the fifteenth to Jeremoth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day
the sixteenth to Hananiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory
the seventeenth to Joshbekashah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit
the eighteenth to Hanani, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord
the nineteenth to Mallothi, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
(for we walk by faith, not by sight:)
the twentieth to Eliathah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord
the one and twentieth to Hothir, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him
the two and twentieth to Giddalti, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad
the three and twentieth to Mahazioth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause
the four and twentieth to Romamti-ezer, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again
Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men of valour
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new
The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah
We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain
All these of the sons of Obed-edom: they and their sons and their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were threescore and two of Obed-edom
(For he saith,
And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen
I have heard thee in a time accepted,
Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)
And in the day of salvation have I succoured thee:
Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD
Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed
And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate
But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses
And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah
in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings
Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward
by honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true
To Obed-edom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim
as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed
To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward
as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things
Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and toward Asuppim two and two
O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged
At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar
Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels
These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore, and among the sons of Merari
Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged
And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things
Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God
As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite, were Jehieli
Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man
The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were over the treasures of the house of the LORD
Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus
Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites
For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season
and Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the treasures
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death
And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son
Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you
Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated
Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all
Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the LORD
And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him
And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren
I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things
Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges
Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia
And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valour, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in the service of the king
how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality
Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers
praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints
In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead
And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God
And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king
Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also
Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand
I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love
Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich
And over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite, and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand
And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago
The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were twenty and four thousand
Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have
The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand
For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not
The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand
But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you
The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and four thousand
For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you
The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand
And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches
The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anetothite, of the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand
avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us
The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand
providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men
The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and four thousand
Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf
The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand
For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you
of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham
Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready
These were the princes of the tribes of Israel
lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting
But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens
But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully
and over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub
Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver
and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work
All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David's
Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)
Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons
being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God
and of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel
For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God
And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father
and by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you
Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day
Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift
Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh
Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat
and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled
and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things
Do ye look on things after the outward appearance
also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD
If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's
He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service
For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed
And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver
that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters
also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver
For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD
Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present
And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD
But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you
Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God
For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ
Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance
Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me
Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house
For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ
even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal
But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ
Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly
For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him
and gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron
As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia
And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite
God knoweth
Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy
But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we
But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort
Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works
for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee
I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little
For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding
That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting
O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own
Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also
O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee
For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise
And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God
For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face
And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king
I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak
and did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness
Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also
And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest
Are they Hebrews
Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him
so am I
And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king
Are they Israelites
And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel
so am I
Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel
Are they the seed of Abraham
And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem
so am I
Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer
Are they ministers of Christ
Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat
(I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft
So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king
Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one
And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not
Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep
Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him
in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren
And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so
Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches
and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom
Who is weak, and I am not weak
But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah
who is offended, and I burn not
but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not
If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities
Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not
And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not
In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me
and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called
and through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands
And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him
And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders
how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter
And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in
Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities
And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet
And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure
And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me
And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness
But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called
Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me
And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong
The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon
I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing
and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon
But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile
So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon
and lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed
And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them
I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare
And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king
For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God
And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule
For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you
And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom
But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates
And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth
And the king bowed himself upon the bed
Greet one another with an holy kiss
And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way
for the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever
And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar
Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love
Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father
I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man
And this is love, that we walk after his commandments
and keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself
This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it
Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet
For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace
This is a deceiver and an antichrist
But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother
Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God
And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword
He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son
So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David
for he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds
And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem
grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord
Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly
And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge
And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD
and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity
And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king
But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins
Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life
for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died
Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth
So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh
Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance
And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah
knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me
So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness
Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance
And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar
knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation
And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither
And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of
And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do
For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment
And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days
and delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked
And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again
(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)
So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died
the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished
And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon
For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error
And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about
For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning
Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days
whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished
And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places
Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness
And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day
Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless
And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in
Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness
And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude
grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing
so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure
And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment
which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer
behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee
seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you
And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days
Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him
And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream
Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things
And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants
And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie
Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him
that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness
And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house
Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle
And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it
comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work
And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom
Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you
And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith
And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son
And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ
Thus they spake before the king
Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread
And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other
But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing
And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment

the son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also

and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables

And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon
Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry
And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen
And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus
And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing

Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth
And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore

And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt
Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers
And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five
because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles
And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes
We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth
And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom
I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee
And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David
The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach
And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying
and, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me
Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power
But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent
Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey
And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name
And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)
And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people
For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry
And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir
And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood
So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire
And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias
And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year
And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place
And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together
And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting
And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men
And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them
And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains
And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven
beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work
And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilæans
And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house
And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born
And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house
Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judæa, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia
And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD
For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day
And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits
But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel
And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house
And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God,
And for the house he made windows of narrow lights
I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh:
And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about
And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building
And your young men shall see visions,
The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third
And your old men shall dream dreams
And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar
And on my servants and on my handmaidens
And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying
I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy
Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father
For David speaketh concerning him,
So Solomon built the house, and finished it
I foresaw the Lord always before my face,
And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir
For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved
And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place
Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad;
And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long
Moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope
And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen
Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell,
And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD
Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption
And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar
he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption
And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold
And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles
And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high
And all that believed were together, and had all things common
And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits
and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need
And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size
who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms
And he overlaid the cherubims with gold
And all the people saw him walking and praising God
And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without
And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this
And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without
And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers
And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord
The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees
and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you
So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall
Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days
And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work
being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead
And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams
And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide
and in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it
And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes
So was he seven years in building it
and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem
But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel
And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row
But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves
And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks
saying, What shall we do to these men
And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks
for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it
And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them
But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye
And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits
For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed
And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house
And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them
And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre
And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is
For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about
And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word
And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits
Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold
and nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter
And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him
And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter
And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in
And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits
And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things
And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter
And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them
And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished
Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them
And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about
Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation
And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast
and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison
It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward
But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said
And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths
Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow
And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it
saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name
and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work
Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men
And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit
When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them
And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten
and said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men
And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself
After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed
And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same
Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables
For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about
Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business
After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people
Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver
and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law
and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars
And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel
and the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases
And he said,
and one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea
Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran
In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan
And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place
And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out
But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first
Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion
Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls
And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month
Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph
And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark
The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live
And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude
And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel
And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims
And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian
For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above
for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not
There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt
But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us
And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD
Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground
so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD
This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge
Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness
the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush
And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)
When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth
and he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying
Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word
And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel
And there was great joy in that city
And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart
And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries
who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day
But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women
And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father
(for as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
But will God indeed dwell on the earth
Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost
behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money
Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day
But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money
that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God
And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive
And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this
If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house
And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven
then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers
And he said, Who art thou, Lord
When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them
And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks
then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance
And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man
If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be
Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem
what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house
But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel
then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him
that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers
but their laying await was known of Saul
Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake
And they watched the gates day and night to kill him
(for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house
Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket
hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name
And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda
If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name
And Peter said unto him, Æneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed
then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause
And he arose immediately
If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near
And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord
then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause
And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter
and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them
and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa
that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee
wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air
And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven
While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee
And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying
and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God
The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us
Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons
that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers
but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him
And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require
that word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judæa, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached
that all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else
him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly
And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD
And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead
And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep
While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word
So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD
And the apostles and brethren that were in Judæa heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God
The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings
I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me
And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days
And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning
On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people
And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus
And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do
And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord
that the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon
Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch
And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments
Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul
But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them
Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword
And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house
Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him
(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee
But the word of God grew and multiplied
And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith
And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother
Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience
And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day
Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus
And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold
when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel
And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer
Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent
For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife
And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre
And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether
But God raised him from the dead
and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land
but he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption
and all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion
Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins
And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel
And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath
their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day
And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region
But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen
But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles
These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work
And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked
But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo
the same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed
And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD
said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet
So he finished the house
And he leaped and walked
And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom
who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways
And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon
And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia
And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon
And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter
And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions
And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me
And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built
Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name
and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her
And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written
And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom
After this I will return,
Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard
And will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down;
And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones
And I will build again the ruins thereof,
And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty
And I will set it up
So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants
That the residue of men might seek after the Lord,
Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold
And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called,
beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country
Saith the Lord, who doeth all these things
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold
Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God
The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays
men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom
For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things
For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks
which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation
So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom
which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium
And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart
And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily
And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year
Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia
And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance
after they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not
And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price
And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas
And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart
And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them
For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father
And this did she many days
For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites
But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her
And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father
And he came out the same hour
Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon
And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers
And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods
And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house
And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice
And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go
and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded
And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things
Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant
But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people
Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son
Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry
And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom
For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD
For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom
Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you
(for six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)
neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things
that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child
So Paul departed from among them
And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen
After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth
And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country
And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks
And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah
And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ
and he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus
And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them
And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria
And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat
And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king
And he drave them from the judgment seat
And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father
When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not
And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph
When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field
And all the men were about twelve
and Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces
And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks
and he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee
And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul
(but he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them
because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father
And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified
Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed
but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes
And the same time there arose no small stir about that way
And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there
And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not
And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel
For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess
And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years
But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly
And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead
And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia
And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king
And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus
And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted
And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me
And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene
And the people departed
For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost
And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people
And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church
But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him
And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons
And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him
testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ
Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat
save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me
Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died
Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men
Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God
So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day
Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them
And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon
I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel
But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying
Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me
Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying
And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all
Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel
And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him
And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David
And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem
if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah
And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly
And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan
And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry
And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan
and they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs
And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi
What is it therefore
And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense
the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come
And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Beth-el, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him
Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them
And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him
And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people
The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD
And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me
And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again
And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me
And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before
For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard
And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place
And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee
So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el
And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth
So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water
And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided
And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back
And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy
and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee
And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul
And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back
And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul
And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase
And he wrote a letter after this manner
And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt
This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman
And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass
And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council
And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him
who, when they came to Cæsarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him
And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones
we accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness
for the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass
Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words
After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places
because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship
And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth
neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me
At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick
And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men
Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel
Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me
but hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back
Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council
therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone
And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him
Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it
He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him
Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die
Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Cæsarea to Jerusalem
And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam
And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove
Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what
And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Cæsarea to salute Festus
even now
Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed
For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger
Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord
And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died
Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write
and they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet
I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews
And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews
And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead
And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers
For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead
And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel
I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth
And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests
And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house
And I said, Who art thou, Lord
And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber
And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest
Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision
And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days
For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me
Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah
King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets
Three years reigned he in Jerusalem
And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia
And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom
Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul
And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father
But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon
Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem
And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship
because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite
and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship
And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life
But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss
Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me
And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam
Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off
And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah
And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat
And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem
And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls
And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom
And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea
And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father
And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape
And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made
And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita
But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days
And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand
And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels
So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed
And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days
And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days
And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah
And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him
Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying
And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not
And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah
For the heart of this people is waxed gross,
Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah
And their ears are dull of hearing,
The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
And their eyes have they closed;
Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet
Lest they should see with their eyes,
And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years
And hear with their ears,
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin
And understand with their heart,
Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead
And should be converted,
And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite
And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves
because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger
I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD
Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom

Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat
but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind
Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
and their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD
And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime

and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD
And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked
Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet
but I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem
for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes

And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah
Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves
And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died
Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself
for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin
neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself
Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD

And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him
shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all
And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him
Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid
And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria
shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it
And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying
Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets

So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan
the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy
And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook
Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof

So he arose and went to Zarephath

Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table
For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right
So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel
Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken
And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions
Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas
if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him

And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them
the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light
And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded
As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him

and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed
Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts
And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water
But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream
Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench
Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel
And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain
But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves
And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel
Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts
And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword
Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near

and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room
that drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph

And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee
And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children
and he shall say, No
Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do
Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD
And the messengers departed, and brought him word again
For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts
And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array
Shall horses run upon the rock
And they set themselves in array against the city
will one plow there with oxen
So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them
for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock
And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter
ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength
And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee
But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness
And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part
And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel
Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise
And they pitched one over against the other seven days
for he is small
And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day
The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD
But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left
Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand
And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber
And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou
Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee
And I said, A plumbline
And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him
Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more
Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee
Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words
And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him
For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land
And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets
Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there
And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria
but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court
And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria
Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit
And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee
and the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel
And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers
Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac
And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land
So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth
Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail
And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them
That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat
They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people
The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works
And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king
Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein
Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died
and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt
And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day
And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD
Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it
and they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it
But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up
In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst
And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel
Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down
And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying
and though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them
And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel
And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt
And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel
Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil
For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth
And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left
All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead
And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother
And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle
We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you
And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints
And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out
for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel
And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him
which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth
So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria
who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit
And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake
For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding
Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness
So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead
giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light
And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel
who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son
Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem
in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins
And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi
and he is before all things, and by him all things consist
And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places
For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell
And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel
and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land
whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God
There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king
even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints
Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber
whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily
And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead
in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel
And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words
for he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done
For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ
Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite
As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him
And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh
For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily
And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there
blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross
And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions
and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it
but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb
Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days
And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb
Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances
Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou
(touch not; taste not; handle not
and why eatest thou not
If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God
and why is thy heart grieved
Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth
am not I better to thee than ten sons
For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God
And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore
When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory
And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head
for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience
And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth
in the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them
Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto
Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds
Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him
and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him
And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight
where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all
So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad
Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering
And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow
And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness
But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever
And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him
And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord
And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD
Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them
For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him
Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged
therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD
and whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men
And he worshipped the LORD there
But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons
And Hannah prayed, and said,
Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven
My heart rejoiceth in the LORD,
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time
Mine horn is exalted in the LORD:
Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man
My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;
whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts
Because I rejoice in thy salvation
For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis
There is none holy as the LORD:
And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it
For there is none beside thee:
In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it
Neither is there any rock like our God
And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes
Talk no more so exceeding proudly;
children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans
Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth:
And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king
For the LORD is a God of knowledge,
Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah
And by him actions are weighed
unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego
The bows of the mighty men are broken,
But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself
And they that stumbled are girded with strength
Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs
They that were full have hired out themselves for bread;
Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah
And they that were hungry ceased:
Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants
So that the barren hath born seven;
So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days
And she that hath many children is waxed feeble
And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat
The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich:
Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse
He bringeth low, and lifteth up
Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king
And lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill,
And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm
To set them among princes,
And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus
And to make them inherit the throne of glory:
And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him
For the pillars of the earth are the LORD's,
Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams
And he hath set the world upon them
So they came and stood before the king
He will keep the feet of his saints,
So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son
And the wicked shall be silent in darkness;
And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream
For by strength shall no man prevail
And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel
Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD
But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof
And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand
But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen
And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force
Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son
But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod
They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it
Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice
The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel
And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD
The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me
And they went unto their own home
Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel
And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters
The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean
And the child Samuel grew before the LORD
And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh
Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon
And he said unto them, Why do ye such things
Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth
for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people
And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain
Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress
The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn
If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him
he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king
Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them
Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel
And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men
Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation
And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house
Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions
And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever
that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon
And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them
Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God
And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever
The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered
And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread
and he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding
And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli
O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field
And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision
The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness
And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see
Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah
and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep
Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation
that the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I
Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation
And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me
The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof
And he said, I called not; lie down again
Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king
And he went and lay down
The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run
And the LORD called yet again, Samuel
As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass
And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me
But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart
And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again
Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness
Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him
Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image
And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle
This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible
In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end
This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass
For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not
They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief
And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever
his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay
And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD
The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining
And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision
Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces
And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him
Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth
And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good
Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory
And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD
And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali
And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD
Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God
And the word of Samuel came to all Israel
For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name
Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek
Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly
And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men
And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth
And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines
And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely
Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies
And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies
And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again
And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise
And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews
And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay
And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp
I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD
And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp
Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people
And they said, Woe unto us
And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken
for there hath not been such a thing heretofore
And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth
Woe unto us
And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay
who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods
And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever
these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness
Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things
And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain
Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him
And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head
The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret
And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God
Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king
And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon
And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult
Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up
And the man came in hastily, and told Eli
and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit
And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army
Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages
And he said, What is there done, my son
And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke
And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy
that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up
And he had judged Israel forty years
The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come
And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her
Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son
Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews
But she answered not, neither did she regard it
They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever
And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband
Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image
And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace
And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod
Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up
When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter
Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day
But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up
But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof
Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated
And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god
And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace
And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven
Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace
And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months
Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego
And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD
And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace
tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire
And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you
They answered and said unto the king, True, O king
Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him
He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God
They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords
Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither
Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land
Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the fire
Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts
Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God
when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed
Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort
Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon
And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home
Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you
and they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods
I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me
And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it
I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace
And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day
I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me
And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God
So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley
and to whom shall he go up from us
Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream
And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you
For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem
And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD
and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee
And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD
Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof
Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only
And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink
And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD
For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim
And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines
Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine
And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car
will ye render me a recompence
And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life
and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head
And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places
because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things
And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel
the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border
Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer-sheba
O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof
And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment
Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head
Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah
The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth
And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them
and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken it
According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee
the leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it
And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king
I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven
And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots
he cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches
And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers
Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about
And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants
nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth
And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants
let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him
And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work
The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining
He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants
This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men
And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day
This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen
Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us
Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee
that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles
Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him
And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD
The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee
And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king
Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies
And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city
The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth
Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power
whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation
And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost
But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation
And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses
it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth
And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not
this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king
And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us
that they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will
And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way
And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule
Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go
All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar
So they went unto the city where the man of God was
At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon
And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here
The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty
And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place
While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee
Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying
And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will
Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is
The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws
And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found
and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou
And on whom is all the desire of Israel
Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase
Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house
Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand
And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons
Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein
And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee
Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them
And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house
They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone
And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away
In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote
And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad
Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another
Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance
Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof
When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son
Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied
After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy
Then was Daniel brought in before the king
and the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man
And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry
And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day
I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee
And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish
And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing
Is Saul also among the prophets
O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour
And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father
But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him
Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets
And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this
And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place
then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written
And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye
This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it
And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel
TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting
And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you
PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians
And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found
Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom
But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not
In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain
And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh
And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old
and said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you
It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom
and ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us
Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm
Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands
Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God
And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken
Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever
Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither
All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions
And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff
Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not
Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD
Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree
And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house
Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God
And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched
Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions
But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us
The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not
And they despised him, and brought him no presents
Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day
But he held his peace
Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him
And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel
Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed
And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee
Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions
And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep
Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee
And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh
And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel
And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly
Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him
And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen
Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions
And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent
Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever
And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand
My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt
Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you
Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den
And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us
So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God
bring the men, that we may put them to death
Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you
And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel
I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end
Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there
He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions
And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you
So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian
And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand
Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea
And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand
And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another
And they answered, He is witness
The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it
And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt
As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time
Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers
I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me
When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place
I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this
And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them
So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things
And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee
These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth
And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe
But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever
And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king
Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet
Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired
I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them
and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you
until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom
If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God
Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces
but if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers
And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings
Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes
And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time
Is it not wheat harvest to day
But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end
I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king
Hitherto is the end of the matter
So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel
As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart
And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king
In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first
and turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain
And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai
For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people
Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last
only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you
And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes
But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king
And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand
And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines
Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven
And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal
And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land
And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead
And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them
As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling
Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down
And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him
And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered
And Samuel said, What hast thou done
And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed
And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash
And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man
And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash
And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision
And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual
Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright
and another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness
And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be
Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears
The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia
but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock
And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king
So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found
Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power
And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash
And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up
Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side
In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans
But he told not his father
in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem
And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men
And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes
The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah
we have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments
And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart
neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land
Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them
O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee
If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them
O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee
But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us
To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him
And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him
neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets
And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow
And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem
And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another
As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth
And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God
Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice
For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel
Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake
And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture
And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God
Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan
yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation
So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven
And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding
And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies
Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy
So none of the people tasted any food
Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times
And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground
In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks
And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath
I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled
But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened
And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel
Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day
then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz
And the people were faint
his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude
Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey
And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves
And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint
Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground
And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood
And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands
Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood
And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent
And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day
And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling
And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD
Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words
And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia
And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee
Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days
Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God
And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb
And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines
For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord
wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel
for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me
But he answered him not that day
Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me
And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day
Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee
For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die
and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come
But there was not a man among all the people that answered him
And now will I shew thee the truth
Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done
Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia
And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die
And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will
And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan
And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those
Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place
And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion
So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them
And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times
And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them
But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail
And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel
and shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north
And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him
So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt
But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress
And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley
And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand
And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt
And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it
So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites
For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches
And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt
And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall
And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword
So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand
But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly
But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed
Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying
He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him
It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments
Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found
And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night
Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle
And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal
And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries
And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear
And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant
And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed
And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people
Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night
He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time
And he said unto him, Say on
Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain
And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed
And both these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed
And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites
Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land
But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal
At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter
And Samuel said,
And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate
Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices,
And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits
As in obeying the voice of the LORD
And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,
Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries
And to hearken than the fat of rams
And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed
For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft,
But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things
And stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry
He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape
Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD,
But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps
He hath also rejected thee from being king
But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many
Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD
And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt
And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel
And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever
And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent
Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river
And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou
And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders
And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent
And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished
Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God
And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end
So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD
And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days
Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul
Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days
And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel
grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ
And Samuel said, How can I go
having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will
if Saul hear it, he will kill me
to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved
And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD
wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence
And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will
And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice
that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ
And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him
which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory
And he sent, and brought him in
Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints
Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to
cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers
And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him
But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints
And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power
Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well
which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places
And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me
far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come
Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep
And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins
And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul
wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience
And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight
that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him
not of works, lest any man should boast
Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim
Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands
And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines
but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ
And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them
For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father
And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span
Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God
And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass
in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord
And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders
if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward
And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him
how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words
And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array
whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul
to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God
choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me
according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord
If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us
in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him
And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid
of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named
Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul
that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man
But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Beth-lehem
may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height
And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us
And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren
unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end
and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge
with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love
Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines
endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace
For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army
But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ
And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them
(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth
And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid
And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers
And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up
till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ
surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel
that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive
And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel
But ye have not so learned Christ
for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God
if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus
And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him
and be renewed in the spirit of your mind
And David said, What have I now done
and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness
Is there not a cause
Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another
And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner
Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath
And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him
neither give place to the devil
And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth
Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth
And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers
and I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him
And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption
Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice
And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail
and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you
And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine
Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children
And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him
But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints
And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance
Be not ye therefore partakers with them
And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves
(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
And the Philistine cursed David by his gods
proving what is acceptable unto the Lord
And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field
For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret
Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied
redeeming the time, because the days are evil
And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands
Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is
And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine
And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit
And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord
Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith
giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled
submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God
And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord
And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron
For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body
And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents
Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing
And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent
Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it
And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is
that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word
And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand
So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies
And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man
He that loveth his wife loveth himself
And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite
For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church
And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul
for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones
And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house
Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right
Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul
that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth
And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle
And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord
And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick
with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men
And the women answered one another as they played, and said,
knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free
Saul hath slain his thousands,
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might
And David his ten thousands
Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil
And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places
And Saul eyed David from that day and forward
and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace
And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it
above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
And David avoided out of his presence twice
praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints
And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul
and for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel
And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him
whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts
Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him
Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them
Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God
And David said unto Saul, Who am I
In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity
and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king
the word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him
But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife
And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire
And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him
And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings
Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain
And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass
And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law
And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings
And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David
As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle
And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies
And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went
But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines
As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning
And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired
And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning
And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him
Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces
And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually
The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel
Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by
When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went
And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David
As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four
and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee
Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels
And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good
When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels
And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain
And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above
And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him
And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies
And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand
And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings
Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain
And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it
So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped
And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about
And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth
As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about
And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick
This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD
And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him
And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake
And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster
And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee
And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped
And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day
And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee
And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them
So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him
And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious
And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth
And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein
And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied
and he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe
And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise
So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll
And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also
And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee
Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David
Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness
And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah
And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them
And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah
For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel
And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night
Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads
Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets
Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears
And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death
I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing
Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee
So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me
And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even
Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days
If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family
And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him
Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me
And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field
Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul
And they went out both of them into the field
Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand
but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth
Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face
Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty
Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house
And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel
But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them
And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows
and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house
If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth
But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house
But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away
Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem
So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat
and lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about
And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty
Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it
And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem
This shall be a sign to the house of Israel
Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness
For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel
And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain
And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year
what hath he done
Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it
And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David
And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege
So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame
Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof
And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him
And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it
And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot
Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink
And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him
Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment
And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee
And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair
And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not
Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts
And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master
Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her
But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations
And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city
And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations
And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded
A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them
Now therefore what is under thine hand
Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by
give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present
When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread
And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away
Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them
Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul
and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places
And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword
And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols
for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste
And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars
And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here
And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the LORD
And David said, There is none like that; give it me
Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries
And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath
And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them
And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land
Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols
did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying,
Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come
Saul hath slain his thousands,
An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come
And David his ten thousands
The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains
And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath
Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations
And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard
Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of their's: neither shall there be wailing for them
Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me
They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof
Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence
But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity
shall this fellow come into my house
All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water
David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him
And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it
And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men
My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it
And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me
Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence
And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold
Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled
Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub
Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none
And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine
And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me
Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king
Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber
And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub
And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain
And he answered, Here I am, my lord
Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north
And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house
So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry
And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests
He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do
And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod
even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary
And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword
And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall
And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David
So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about
And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests
Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man
Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard
turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these
Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors
And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east
Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines
And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house
And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah
And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side
And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines
And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity
And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand
Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne
And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men
And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city
And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod
And he went in in my sight
Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake
Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court
Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand
And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh
will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard
And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels
O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant
And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out
And the LORD said, He will come down
And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings
Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul
And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone
And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up
And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel
Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go
And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had
And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth
And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle
And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph
And the cherubims were lifted up
And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand
This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar
And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood
And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them
And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God
When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them
And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house
Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims
Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon
This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims
Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand
Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings
And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me
Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city
Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly
Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain
And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it
But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land
Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD
Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth
And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you
And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi
This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel
And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats
And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence
And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt
And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh
And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD
that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God
David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king
And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city
And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself
Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity
And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt
So the vision that I had seen went up from me
Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed
Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me
And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David
The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying
And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept
Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house
And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil
Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity
And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not
Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby
For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away
And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying
wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day
And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them
And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand
And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries
Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house
But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD
And David sware unto Saul
Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying
And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold
Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness
And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah
and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein
And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel
Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision
Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb
For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel
And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep
Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying
And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name
Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off
and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing
and who is the son of Jesse
O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts
there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master
Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD
Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be
They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word
So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings
Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not spoken
And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD
And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it
But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them
So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the LORD
But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields
and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls
they were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep
Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you
Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him
And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies
And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them
Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly
Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good
Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the LORD
And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground
Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life
Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send
Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me
Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord
Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols
Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling
that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols
And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel
For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself
And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me
And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel
For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall
And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him
So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person
The word of the LORD came again to me, saying
But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone
Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it
And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died
If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts
And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife
though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate
And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord
Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it
And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of her's that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife
though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves
David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives
Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast
But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim
though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness
And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon
For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast
Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed
Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest
And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him
Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work
Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp
or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon
And Abishai said, I will go down with thee
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem
And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless
And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them
David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them
Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations
Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them
and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite
and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner
And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all
Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king
None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born
This thing is not good that thou hast done
Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil
As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed
I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk
And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster
I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck
And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David
And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD
And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king
But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was
Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant
Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them
If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods
and tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them
And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath
My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD
And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him
Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured
Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day
Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter
And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months
that thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them
And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt
And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood
And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day
that thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street
And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites
Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms
And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever
Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger
And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel
Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way
And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men
Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith
And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do
How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman
And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever
in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire
Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city
but as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband
And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land
They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom
And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa
And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary
And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled
Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD
And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them
And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee
And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy
And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing
They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords
Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee
So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry
And he said, Bring me up Samuel
Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations
And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me
Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite
for thou art Saul
And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters
And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters
And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth
Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy
Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy
And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good
because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day
When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them
Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night
that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them
Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way
For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride
And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof
Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD
Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel
For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant
And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish
Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant
And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master
And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD
should it not be with the heads of these men
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying,
Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel
Saul slew his thousands,
he cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants
And David his ten thousands
He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart
And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs
And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire
It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine
So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives
Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper
Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep
shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither
And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite
it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof
But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water
that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand
We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire
But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people
And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company
Shall he prosper
And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company
shall he escape that doeth such things
And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives
or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered
And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die
And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil
Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons
And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them
seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape
Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head
Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand
And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me
For who will hearken unto you in this matter
The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying
but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel
And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day
Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die
to them which were in Beth-el, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir
But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right
and to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa
and hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment
and to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites
he that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man
and to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chor-ashan, and to them which were in Athach
If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things
and to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt
and that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife
Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa
hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination
And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchi-shua, Saul's sons
Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like
And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers
that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife
And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him
neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment
So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together
that hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live
And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them
As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity
And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa
The soul that sinneth, it shall die
And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people
The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him
And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan
But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die
And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul
All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live
all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there
Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die
And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days
saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live
And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly
But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live
Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers
All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die
So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness
Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal
Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it
Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal
And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it
are not your ways unequal
And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead
When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die
Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude
Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive
And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king
Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die
wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like
Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD
And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem
Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin
And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance
Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel
And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price
For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye
And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means
Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel
And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom
And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men
And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them
The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt
Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide
Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion
Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants
And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men
even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great
And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring
Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom
Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit
And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's
And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel
Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants
Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters
And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred
And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground
And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work
And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me
Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite
Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying
And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign
Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me
And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you
And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim
Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them
He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls
cause them to know the abominations of their fathers
And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents
in the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands
And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold
Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness
And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub
And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them
And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub
Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them
The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward
But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out
And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon
Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands
Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits
because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols
And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains
Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness
And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz
But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols
Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof
I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them
Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about
and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God
It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward
Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth
And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths
I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries
He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in
because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols
And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left
Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live
Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass
and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD
And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south
Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me
And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you
And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God
and I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out
to wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars
And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face
and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars
Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD
He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases
And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant
one sea, and twelve oxen under it
I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen
In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah
And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers
Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out
And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed
And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set
And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD
moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold
Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field
and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold
And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched
Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion
Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel
Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month
Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north
And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark
Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes
And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude
Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished
And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims
it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth
for the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above
it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree
There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt
Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers
And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course
Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set
also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)
The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God
Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city
Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness
Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced
And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood
At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort
Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel
And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken
Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand
But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart
And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end
notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name
Shall I cause it to return into his sheath
The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel
I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity
And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands
And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy
for Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day
Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city
Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David
yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations
But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth
Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself
Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built
Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed
Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee
Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood
Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive
In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow
If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house
Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths
And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house
In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness
then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers
In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution
When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them
And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter
If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be
In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD
then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house
Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee
then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)
Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee
that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers
I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it
Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house
And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee
then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name
And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD
If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause
Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver
If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem
yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly
As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you
if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name
Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof
then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house
Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain
And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house
The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully
Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD
And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none
And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying
Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat
and they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity
Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt
And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours
And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days
Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself
And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people
Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her
Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected
Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted
If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people
And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms
if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land
She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men
Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place
Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way
For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually
and that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion
And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments
girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity
then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea
But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them
So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister
then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations
Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt
And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house
For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses
that the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there
Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side
And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it
They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels
And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath
Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more
Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated
and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion
and they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms
As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much
but of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day
Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria
But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen
The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah
And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people
yea, declare unto them their abominations
And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come
that they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them
Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch
Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths
even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles
And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments
And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded
and satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil
And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures
Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them
Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom
Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women
And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon
For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled
And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart
And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire
And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not
Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness
And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built
And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD
and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her
Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom
Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day
howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard
And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it
Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom
gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones
And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon
Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it
And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones
bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it
And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah
For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust
Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold
that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered
And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold
I will even make the pile for fire great
And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays
Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned
And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon
Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed
For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks
She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire
And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom
In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee
And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart
Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year
Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down
And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem
Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt
And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men
And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance
And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another
And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands
Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat
that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears
And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying
And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead
Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them
And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king
And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD
And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel
And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen
And the people departed
therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim
But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him
unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations
For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword
And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred
So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast
But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them
And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day
It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations
And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam
And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD
But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people
Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying
He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee
Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me
And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers
And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam
With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground
And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah
And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water
He built even Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa
And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard
and Beth-zur, and Shoco, and Adullam
And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD
and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph
Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee
and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah
Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure
And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine
For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee
And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying
And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts
Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus
For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD
and say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, which art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of perfect beauty
and he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made
Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty
And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers
They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee
So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon
Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Chittim
And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse
Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee
which bare him children; Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham
The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots
And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith
They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness
And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king
Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs
And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him
Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market
And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD
They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules
with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians
Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate
And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem
Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm
And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak
Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool
Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries
Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market
So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made
Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots
Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house
Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy merchants
And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber
The merchants of Sheba and Raamah: they were thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold
And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well
Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were thy merchants
And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD
These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead
The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas
Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah
Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas
He reigned three years in Jerusalem
Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin
His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah
The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots
And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam
And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land
And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour
and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes
And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel
and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing
ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt
And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea
Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord
In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall
And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them
All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance
Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying
so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods
Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God
But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business
behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee
But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them
with thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures
And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand
by thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches
And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God
Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers
behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness
And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof
They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas
Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died
Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God
But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters
but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee
And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead
Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty
In his days the land was quiet ten years
Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee
And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God
By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire
for he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
and commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment
Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it
Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him
In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest
Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt
Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side
And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel
So they built and prospered
When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand
And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee
And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah
Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia
Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah
No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years
So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled
And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries
And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them
Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered
They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem
and I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom
And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded
It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations
But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them
And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD
And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries
And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity
Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it
And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying
And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him
Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe worth the day
So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa
And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted
And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep
And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed
And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
that whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman
And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No
And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets
And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No
And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about
The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity
But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days
Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the LORD
And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels
And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand
In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries
Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying
And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man
And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali
And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease
Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness
Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah
Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs
And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand
The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field
Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen
Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth
yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand
All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations
Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing
Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters
And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time
The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty
And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height
And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians
Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches
And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign
to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit
And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him
They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen
And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel
And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken
Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers
And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net
but sought to the LORD God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel
And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height
Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance
I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee
And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah
All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD
Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah
I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known
And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people
For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee
And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat
I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them
Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats
Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD
And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store
When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD
And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem
It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand
Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit
And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour
Whom dost thou pass in beauty
And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war
go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised
These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah
They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes
Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab
The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword
And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them
Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword
And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of their's, and speak thou good
whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living
Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left
Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword
And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself
There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit
Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son
Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes
Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman
So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle
if when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people
For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him
then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head
And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded
But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand
And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died
When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand
And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem
Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul
And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD
Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right
therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD
if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die
And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers
None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live
And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city
When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby
and said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment
But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby
And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart
Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb
It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle
Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazon-tamar, which is Engedi
Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance
And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah
Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land
And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD
Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land
And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court
Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence
and said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven
For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through
and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen
Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD
and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee
And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness
Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever
And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not
And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not
Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock
behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit
And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered
And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children
Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD
Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock
To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out
And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD
As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day
And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high
I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel
And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper
I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD
And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten
And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats
For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another
Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures
And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped
and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet
And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much
And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet
And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle
Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies
Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad
And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD
therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle
And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel
And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid
So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about
And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more
And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD
Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord GOD
Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers
And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord GOD
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly
Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it
and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-geber
Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end
Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works
therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee
And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish
Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth
And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel
And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword
And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn
I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD
Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel
therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee
Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem
Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them
And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD
Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate
Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever
Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD
In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king
therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people
Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots
therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about
So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey
The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers
Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen
Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame
but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself
But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come
behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods
For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown
Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians
and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded
and they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons
Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men
And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations
He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly
therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD
Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram
Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it
And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria
and I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them
And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick
And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land
And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab
But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went
And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them
Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went
But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah
And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes
But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber
For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land
So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not
Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you
And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land
A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh
And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him
And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them
And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem
And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God
And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God
I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you
And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David
And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen
This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors
Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded
and a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD
And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by
But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock
So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses
The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones
Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God
and caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry
And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about
So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone
Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king
And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them
Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD
So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army
and she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise
Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel
Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason
And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves
So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there
and shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD
And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's people
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying
Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars
and join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand
Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David
Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand
And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in
And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes
And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom
And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land
And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword
My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people
And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters
Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him
And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD
and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal
And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter
and I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords
Howbeit the Levites hastened it not
Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet
For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim
Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee
And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD
Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee
And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness
Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought
And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end
and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates
Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again
to take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land
Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance
Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil
And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD
hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey
And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver
Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know it
And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada
And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army
But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died
And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in my face
And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house
For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel
Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king
so that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground
Then the king hearkened unto them
And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be against his brother
And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass
And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone
Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear
Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD
And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD
Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal
And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus
and I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel
For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers
and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand
So they executed judgment against Joash
Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD
And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess
And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD
Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings
Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is the day whereof I have spoken
And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead
And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart
so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD
Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father
And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land
Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield
Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord GOD
He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver
And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog
But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim
And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah
Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger
Thus shall they cleanse the land
And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand
And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood
And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces
Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan
But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil
And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you
Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them
Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD
But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom
And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them
So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah
So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward
And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent
According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them
And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name
And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria
after that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid
And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years
When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations
Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there
Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there
In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither
And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah
Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad
Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah
And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed
He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers
He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did
Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward
And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines
And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits
And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunims
The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side
And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly
He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door
Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them
And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits
Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry
And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm trees
The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred
Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement
And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy
Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward
And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones
And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof
And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal
And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits
And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong
And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them
But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense
And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad
And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men
And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps
Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar
And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these measures
And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him
And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps
Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write
And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering
He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much
And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering
Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers
And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables
He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them
Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices
And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley
And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice
So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third
And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north
So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God
And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah
The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side
He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem
Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle
And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead
Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father
So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place
for he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim
After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side
Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel
And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house
He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree
I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits
Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus
Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits
And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter
So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long
For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers
also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits
And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king
to that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure
And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria
And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces
But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven
so that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about
Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war
From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple
So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation
And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors
And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria
And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door
At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him
And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks
For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives
Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north
For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD
Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits
And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not
Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories
For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not
Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building
And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz
For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground
For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me
And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits
But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel
For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits
And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem
And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court
And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers
The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building
Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done
When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people
He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them
Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about
And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street
He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about
For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs
He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about
Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel
He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed
Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes
He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed
For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this
He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place
Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us
Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east
And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD
and, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory
Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof
And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east
Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD
So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house
And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah
And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me
And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD
Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever
So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar
Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern
And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them
So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns
and the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel
And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof
And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets
And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east
And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets
And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon
And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished
And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering
And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped
And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it
Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD
Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary
And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings
And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock
And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD
When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish
And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep
And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD
But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests
Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish
And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering
Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves
So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order
Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut
And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly
And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary
And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel
And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations
For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month
in that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations
For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem
And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves
And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation
Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel
So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written
And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity
And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see
Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity
So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them
But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein
Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem
But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD
Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD
they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge
And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation
And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within
And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron
They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat
Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD
And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments
And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites
Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads
For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD
Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court
And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people
Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before
And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness
And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean
And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced
And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves
So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem
And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days
Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven
And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord GOD
Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all
They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be their's
Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities
The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast
And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD
Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand
He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD
This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about
Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD
Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof
And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly
And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place
And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps
And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers
In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month
And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel
And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel
In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes
Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps
Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath
And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store
The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer
Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them
And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh
And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God
This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley
And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things
concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer
And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small
and one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD
beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses
All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel
both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses
Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary
and to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court
also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites
And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the house
And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God
In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten
And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered
And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering
After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself
And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering
And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem
And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him
In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil
And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying
Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened
Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him
Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons
with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles
And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish
And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah
And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah
After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying
And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish
Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem
And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof
Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it
But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it
And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah
And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah
Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city
Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning
And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man
And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD
And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven
Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering
And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria
Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance
So he returned with shame of face to his own land
Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession
And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword
After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward
Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side
Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court
And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth
In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure
In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign
And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about
But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem
Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar
Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah
Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side
And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels
And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles
storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks
Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over
Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much
And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this
This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David
Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river
And Hezekiah prospered in all his works
Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other
Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart
Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem
But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt
but did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel
And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance
For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them
And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD
Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazar-hatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran
And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever
So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel
So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel
And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD
And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken
And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Asher
Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon
And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, a portion for Naphtali
And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers
And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Manasseh
Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah
And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Ephraim
And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city
And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, a portion for Reuben
And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel
And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Judah
Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only
And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel
The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD shall be of five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth
His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers
And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst thereof
So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead
It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray
Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem
And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites
But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them
And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand
and humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more
And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst thereof
And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house
And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred
But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead
And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years
And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left
And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel
For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images
All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city
And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them
As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin shall have a portion
And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem
And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon shall have a portion
And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about
And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar a portion
And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem
And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun a portion
Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God
And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad a portion
And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem
And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea
And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house
This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith the Lord GOD
even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed
And these are the goings out of the city on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures
Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters
And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi
And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses
And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan
And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD
And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures: and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulun
And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan
At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their three gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali
And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it
grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ
And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen
to whom be glory for ever and ever
Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book
As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed
And Shaphan read it before the king
For do I now persuade men, or God
And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes
or do I seek to please men
And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect
for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ
And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me
But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man
Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah
For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ
And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard
to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood
because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD
But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother
Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem
Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia
And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD
and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judæa which were in Christ
And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book
Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also
And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it
But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised
And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers
But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me
And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God
but contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter
And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers
(for he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)
Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month
And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation
And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD
He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith
and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham
And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites
that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith
So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses
Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto
And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance
But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster
Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment
For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ
And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus
And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people
And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise
And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them
to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons
So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah
And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father
And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days
Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods
And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept
I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain
After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him
Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first
Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo
Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law
And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations
For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD
Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace
and his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith
Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem
Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth
Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem
This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you
And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
I would they were even cut off which trouble you
And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim
But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law
And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt
Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith
Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon
And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts
Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit
And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem
Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ
Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem
For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD
For every man shall bear his own burden
Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem
Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things
And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place
The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see
but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy
Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance
And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon
for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention
And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof
For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's
And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia
They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying
They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand
Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab
And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them
Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die
Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations
And Elijah departed
And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it
Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty
Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil
And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill
Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul
And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty
For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it
And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty
Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity
Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty
For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea
And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty
Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness

A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth
And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him

And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son
Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel

And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace
Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD
And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho
Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit
And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee
Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD
So they came to Jericho
And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God
And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day
in the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king
And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace
In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying
And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan
Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying
And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground
Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory
And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven
and how do ye see it now
He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan
Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts
and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah
For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land
and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over
and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts
And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha

And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him
In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying
And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying
And they brought it to him
since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty
So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake
Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it
And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD
And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying
And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them
Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth

God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets
Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years
And of the angels he saith,
And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made
Who maketh his angels spirits,
And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool
But unto the Son he saith,
But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel
A sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom
So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them
They shall perish; but thou remainest:
And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him
And they all shall wax old as doth a garment
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him
And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up,
And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee
And they shall be changed:
But now bring me a minstrel
But thou art the same,
And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation
And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches
Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip
For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts
For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak
And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water
But one in a certain place testified, saying,
And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border
What is man, that thou art mindful of him
And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood
Or the son of man, that thou visitest him
And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not
Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil
Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall
For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham
And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land
For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted
And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread
who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house
And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread
Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith,
And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually
To day if ye will hear his voice
And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there
Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,
And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life
In the day of temptation in the wilderness
And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers
When your fathers tempted me, proved me,
And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died
And saw my works forty years
And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out
So I sware in my wrath,
Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord
They shall not enter into my rest
And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee
Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God
And he arose, and followed her
But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin
And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed
So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief
He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD
Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it
And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm
For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it
Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes
There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God
Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out
For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his
And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not
Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief
But he said, Then bring meal
Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do
And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat
Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession
And there was no harm in the pot
For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD
who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity
Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper
And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins
And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife
though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered
And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria
and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him
And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel
called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec
And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel
Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing
And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil
So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God
But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper
And this will we do, if God permit
Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel
For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost
may I not wash in them, and be clean
and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come
So he turned and went away in a rage
if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame
But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none
For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God
And he urged him to take it; but he refused
But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak
And he said unto him, Go in peace
For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister
So he departed from him a little way
And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end
And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed
that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises
And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee
Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath
Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants
And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham
The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever
And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better
And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow
For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him
And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us
For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law
So he went with them
For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar
And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood
And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest
Therefore said he, Take it up to thee
For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof
And he put out his hand, and took it
And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest
And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice
By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament
Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel
And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death
Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about
but this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood
And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots
For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer
And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master
For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second
And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see
In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old
And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha
Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away
And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness
Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary
And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha
Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God
And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see
the Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing
And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria
For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh
And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master
For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator
So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel
For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth
And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria
Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood
And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver
For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people
Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria
And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment
And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there
For then would they not have ceased to be offered
Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life
because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins
And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within
Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith,
And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste
Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not,
And the messengers returned, and told the king
But a body hast thou prepared me
And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians
then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God
So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD
He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second
And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him
By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all
And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria
And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins
And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died
from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool
And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years
Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin
And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land
Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept
by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh
And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign
and having an high priest over the house of God
Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem
and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works
Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children
For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins
In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves
He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses
Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God
Then Libnah revolted at the same time
partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used
And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise
In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign
But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul
Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem
For by it the elders obtained a good report
And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel
Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable
And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab
For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country
And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram
And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned
And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria
of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called
And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come
And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead
By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff
and when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber
By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones
then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel
By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not
choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season
So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead
esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward
And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel
By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days
And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel
By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace
For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel
And what shall I more say
and I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah
for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets
So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram
and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment
(Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria
(of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth
So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there
And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise
And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram
God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect
And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot
For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds
Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him
Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin
But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house
Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees
And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot
and make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed
And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam
looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled
And he fled to Megiddo, and died there
And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain
And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David
for our God is a consuming fire
And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side
Let brotherly love continue
And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs
Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation
And he said, Throw her down
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever
So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot
Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach
And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands
By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name
And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria
Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly
And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying
But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner
And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel
make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever
So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining
And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words
And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria
Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints
And as he was at the shearing house in the way
They of Italy salute you
Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye
So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son
And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen
And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel
And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD
But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen
So they made him ride in his chariot
Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son
And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah
Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel
And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal
Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah
And they proclaimed it
And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali
And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal
For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name
And he brought them forth vestments
And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely
And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth
And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies
And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal
I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD
And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them
And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth
And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day
So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley
Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel
and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee
And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel
For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim
But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin
The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah
In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel
The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem
from Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan
And the idols he shall utterly abolish
Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon
And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years
the chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers
And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal
the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings
But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain
the rings, and nose jewels
And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house
the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins
And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king
the glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails
And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD
In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel
And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple
And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem
And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD
when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning
And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain
And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain
And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars
In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple
And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD
Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly
And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house
And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke
Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign
Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar
In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem
And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it
And his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba
And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim
And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him
And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind
But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places
Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field
And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD
and say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah
But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house
Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying
And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house
Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying
But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD
Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel
And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD
Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good
Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD
For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings
but they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria
Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully
And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes
The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'
In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard
Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem

And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem
and it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land
And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns
And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla
And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom

And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all their days
The LORD spake also unto me again, saying
And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them
For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying
(And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime
And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God
Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing
for the living to the dead
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward
In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years
And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but he walked therein
Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations
And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever
And he said, Open the window eastward
The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this
And he opened it
the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth
Then Elisha said, Shoot
For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still
And he shot
For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings
And he said, The arrow of the LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them
Is not Calno as Carchemish
And he said, Take the arrows
is not Hamath as Arpad
And he took them
is not Samaria as Damascus
And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea

The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see

In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden
In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah
This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did

In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction
But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin
And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them
And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents

And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah
For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel

Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land
But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel
So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish
And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree
And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee
Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him
And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying
At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day
Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria
And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria
Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered
And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin
Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar
And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus
Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah
And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon
And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD
And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar
And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying
And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar
O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth
Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded
Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries
And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones
Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only
And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses
In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him
And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead
Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents
In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death
And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison
Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD
Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years
Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying
In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes
Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years
and walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made
And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city
And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city
And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken
And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree
The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness
and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger
The LORD was ready to save me:
Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God
Therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments
And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal
All the days of our life in the house of the LORD
And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger
At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered
Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only
And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not
Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made
Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts
And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight
Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD
For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin
To whom then will ye liken God
For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them
or what likeness will ye compare unto him
until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets
Have ye not known
So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day
have ye not heard
And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them
hath it not been told you from the beginning
Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the LORD
have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth
Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt
Who among you will give ear to this
And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima
who will hearken and hear for the time to come
and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim
Who hath believed our report
So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places
and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed
They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence
Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD
with whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them
wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore
but the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice
For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory
And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods
For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain
And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods
James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting
Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner
My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations
So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day
knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience
Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign
But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing
Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem
For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord
His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah
A double minded man is unstable in all his ways
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted
He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him
but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed
For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses
Do not err, my beloved brethren
He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city
Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures
And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it
Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath
because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them
for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God
Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them
For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass
And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house
for he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was
At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed
And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder
If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain
And Rab-shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons
Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war
Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him
Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called
Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them
If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well
But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words
For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all
Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria
If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food
Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand
Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone
Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern
But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead
Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only
Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad
Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way
where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also
have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand
For in many things we offend all
And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD
If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body
And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz
Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body
So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah
but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison
And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me
Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing
Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria
My brethren, these things ought not so to be
Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered
Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you
Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar
let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom
and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them
But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard
This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh
For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work
Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy
And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace
Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD
From whence come wars and fightings among you
And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz
come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members
At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick
But he giveth more grace
And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD
Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness
And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up
Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken
Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin
And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days
Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten
And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth
And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead
Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel
Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord
For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them
Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD
Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh
And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger
Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door
And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever
Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience
But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel
Behold, we count them happy which endure
And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying
Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy
Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols
and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him
therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle
Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed
And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down
The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much
And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies
Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months
Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD
And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him
Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem
to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign
And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah
It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did
Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them
Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD
and he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD
behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child
And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house
But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak
And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead
Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth
Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant
And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead
And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem
And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north
And his mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath
For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left
Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying
And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying
Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown
Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people
Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel
and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house
thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain
unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house
Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead
And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD
Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods
And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it
but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit
And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book
Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD
And Shaphan read it before the king
Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head
And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes
Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way
And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying
And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor
So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her
or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river
And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me
As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets
Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read
Wherefore will ye plead with me
because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched
ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD
But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard
Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire
because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD
yet my people have forgotten me days without number
And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem
Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love
And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book
therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways
And all the people stood to the covenant
Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way
And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Beth-el
thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria
And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people
And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me
And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove
But she returned not
And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city
And her treacherous sister Judah saw it
Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren
And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks
And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech
And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD
And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire
And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah
And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron
even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them
And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile
O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved
And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men
How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words
Shall I not visit for these things
And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones
saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this
So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria
Shall I not visit for these things
And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el
saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this
Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah
A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land
but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem
I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman
Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD
They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace
And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying
Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour
And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre
if ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt
And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead
then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever
Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem
Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit
And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah
Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done
Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem
Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD
And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah
But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done
And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not
In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him
therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh
And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets
And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim
Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did
Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee
and also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon
The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh
So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead
For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices
And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt
But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months
Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them
And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem
yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done
For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it
At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged
And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart
And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place
And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said
And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away
And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon
At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves
And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon
And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts
Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem
And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein
And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah
therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised
And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah
Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel
And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying
And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him
Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem
So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him
and say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant
And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon
Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them
And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem
Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them
and he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt he with fire
Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble
And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about
Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble
Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry away
For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal
But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen
And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou shewedst me their doings
And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon
therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine
And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away
Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them
And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away
But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD
The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight
So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins
And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door
And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying
and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city
So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me
and Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah
And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there
and the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath
Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing
So Judah was carried away out of their land
Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler
Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem
And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men
This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing
But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth
And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees
Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their good
and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon
Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD
and changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life
And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy
And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life
And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem
Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag
Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel
it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance
The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying
And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him
For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land
And he said unto me, Who art thou
neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother
And I answered him, I am an Amalekite
and ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me
He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt
So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord
Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks
Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him
And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things
and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword
Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is
And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou
Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem
And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite
thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem
And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers
And he smote him that he died
And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein
And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son
then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever
Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD
Who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights,
The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying
Who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel
Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels
And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah
And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it
And the LORD said unto him, Go up
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying
And David said, Whither shall I go up
At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it
And he said, Unto Hebron
if that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them
So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite
And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it
And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron
if it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them
And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him
and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee
And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing
Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents
But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim
therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter
and made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel
And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof
And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months
Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee
And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool
Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet
Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David
Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's house; and said to all the people
And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe
Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things
And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner
Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD
And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground
And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks
how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother
Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon
Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon
The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying
And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill
Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah
And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother
Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city
So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more
And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath
And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim
And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence
And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel
And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death
But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died
He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey
And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem
And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the LORD
And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day
Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word
Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker
and say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates
and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital
For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people
and the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife
For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more
These were born to David in Hebron
As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence
And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul
and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans
So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him
And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die
to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba
Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture
And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him
Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him
And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land
saith the LORD
saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee
Do not I fill heaven and earth
And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines
saith the LORD
And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish
which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal
And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you
And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD
And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin
thou shalt then say unto them, What burden
And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth
I will even forsake you, saith the LORD
And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace
And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house
When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace
And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God
Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done
therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence
behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone
The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon
And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not
One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad
And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good
let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread
For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up
So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle
And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt
And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept
The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
And the king lamented over Abner, and said,
the which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying
Died Abner as a fool dieth
And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear
And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people
They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever
For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words
And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel
Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle
And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled
And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations
And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin
For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it
And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet
Then took I the cup at the LORD's hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me
He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame
to wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day
And his name was Mephibosheth
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people
For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night
and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod
And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity
Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon
Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh
and all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea
So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel
Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners
David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years
and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert
In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah
and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes
Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David
Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you
So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David
And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink
And David built round about from Millo and inward
And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground
And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him
In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying
And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house
Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD's house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word
And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake
if so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings
And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David
And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you
And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon
to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened
The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim
then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth
And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines
So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD
wilt thou deliver them into mine hand
Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die
And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand
Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant
And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters
And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD
Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim
When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house
And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them
Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears
And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim
Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard
And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees
As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you
And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer
Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying
And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims
and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt
And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals
and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt
And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it
Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God
In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying
And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day
Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck
So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite
and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah
And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obed-edom, and all his household
and command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters
And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God
And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him
So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness
And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand
And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings
for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish
And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod
Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon
So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet
But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon
And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart
For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city
And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD
which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem
And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts
yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem
Then David returned to bless his household
And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying
And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon
Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death
Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD
And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies
even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD's house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place
And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying
Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people
Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in
the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence
Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle
Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it
In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar
And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years
Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel
And the prophet Jeremiah went his way
and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth
Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying
Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime
Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie
And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom
So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month
He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever
Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon
I will be his father, and he shall be my son
(after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)
If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon
but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee
Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David
take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished
And what can David say more unto thee
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed
for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant
Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you
For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them
know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity
Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears
thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil
And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee
because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD
For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes
And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines
and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire
David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates
Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying
And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying
And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem
the LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks
And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass
Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you
When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer
And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet
which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying
of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying
And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men
And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah
And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants
And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God
And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went
And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks
And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people
Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me
And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast
and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers
And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath
Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar
For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house
Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence
For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it
And David said, Mephibosheth
and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes
And he answered, Behold thy servant
And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually
And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver
Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table
And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances
Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants
So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open
Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do
and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison
As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons
And I charged Baruch before them, saying
So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet
Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying
And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead
which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day
Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away
and hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror
And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ish-tob twelve thousand men
and hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey
And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying
And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ish-tob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it
When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians
and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger
and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon
For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face
Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good
because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him
But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it
And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city
And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence
So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem
behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely
And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together
and they shall be my people, and I will be their God
And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them
and I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them
And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them
and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me
So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more
For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them
And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying
But David tarried still at Jerusalem
Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name
And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon
For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword
And David sent and enquired after the woman
Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth
And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house
And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first
And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite
And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me
And Joab sent Uriah to David
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down
And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered
For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel
And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet
neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually
And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king
And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying
But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house
Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season
And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife
then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers
as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing
Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying
And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart
Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth
So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow
The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying
And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire
And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah
Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were
when the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah
And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also
This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them
Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war
that every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother
and charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king
But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids
and if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight
Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying
knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying
And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate
And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof
Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him
the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf
And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband
The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying
The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds
Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink
And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die
Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites
And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man
But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever
Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul
Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters
and I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things
nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed
Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight
but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us
thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying
Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun
And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you
David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth
And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying
And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them
Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day
And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him
Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book
And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD
And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD
And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city
And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD's house
And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters
And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem
And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it
Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people
And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head
When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD
And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance
then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes
And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon
Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people
So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem
Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come
But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man
So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them
So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand
And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears
And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand
So Baruch read it in their ears
And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother
And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king
Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her
Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him
Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her
And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth
And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled
Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words
Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her
Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them
But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying
And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar
Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned
And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons
Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost
And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant
And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah
And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee
But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah
And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him
Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison
But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him
Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying
And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded
And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire
Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled
And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army
And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left
then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people
Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent
Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison
And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar
When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days
So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years
Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison
And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead
Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land
Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom
Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent
And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead
Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison
and come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him
Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying
So Joab put the words in her mouth
Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin
And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God
Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king, saying
for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished
So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah
So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem
And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords
And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face
And Jeremiah did so
So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face
So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison
But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him
Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house
And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it;) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight
but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand
And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance
But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee
So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face
Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live
Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire
But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me
And Absalom's servants set the field on fire
Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die
And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him
So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken
And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him
In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it
And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel
And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up
And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron
And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon
And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing
And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain
And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices
But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him
And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom
Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah
And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off
Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon
And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king
And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem
And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over
Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained
And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him
But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time
Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there
Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying
And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head
So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the king of Babylon's princes
unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me
Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying
So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem
For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD
And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon
And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came
And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place
And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah
Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go
so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David
So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go
And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it
Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land
let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him
Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon
And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there
then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men
And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him
Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan
And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide
Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah
and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only
and said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee
And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel
But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not
And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time
But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael
And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men
Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land
Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person
Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war
So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one
And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it
And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel
that there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD
For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom
And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him
Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled
But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey
And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known
So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren
And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you
But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done
So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead
then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon
And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim
Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad
and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness
So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah
And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do
But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites
And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands
Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon
And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom
and they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt
And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom
because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land
So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim
Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near
For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured
Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us
And Absalom met the servants of David
And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah
And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away
Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest
And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him
and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him
And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people
If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you
Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen
And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land
And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran
But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God
And the watchman cried, and told the king
and now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there
And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth
then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt, and there ye shall die
And he came apace, and drew near
The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day
And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here
For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it
And he turned aside, and stood still
And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you
And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom
Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn
And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son
And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words
And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle
but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon
And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines
But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah
Then the king arose, and sat in the gate
even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah
And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying
And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent
Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah
And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house
and say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them
So the king returned, and came to Jordan
And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword
And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan
He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire
And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David
The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying
And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good
But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods
And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan
Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain
Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die
in that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth
And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace
Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem
And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah
And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem
For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence
Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward
Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying
Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother
As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee
And all the people went over Jordan
But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil
And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place
Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying
So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem
The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind
And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them
So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day
So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood
Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt
So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him
Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them
And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri
The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying
When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them
Thou didst say, Woe is me now
And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out
The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles
And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway
against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah
And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still
Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle
When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri
The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt
And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down
Why are thy valiant men swept away
Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom
they stood not, because the LORD did drive them
And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab
The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him
And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza
And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king
and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim
Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites
For was not Israel a derision unto thee
and Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder
was he found among thieves
and Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests
for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy
and Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying
And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might
let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose
The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet
And the king said, I will give them
How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken
But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul
how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations
But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite
The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans
And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done
Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets
and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged
The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee
And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded
and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider
And after that God was intreated for the land
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come
And Ishbi-benob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David
Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out
And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant
In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD
And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Beth-lehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam
How is Sheshach taken
And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant
and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised
And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him
how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations
And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul
The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof
and he said,
Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer
And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall
I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised:
My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD
So shall I be saved from mine enemies
Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her
When the waves of death compassed me,
The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign
The floods of ungodly men made me afraid
And this Seraiah was a quiet prince
The sorrows of hell compassed me about;
So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon
The snares of death prevented me
And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words
In my distress I called upon the LORD,
And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates
And cried to my God:
Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem
And he did hear my voice out of his temple,
And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah
And my cry did enter into his ears
And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done
Then the earth shook and trembled;
And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about
The foundations of heaven moved
So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah
And shook, because he was wroth
And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land
He bowed the heavens also, and came down;
Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain
And darkness was under his feet
But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly:
Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him
And he was seen upon the wings of the wind
And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah
And he made darkness pavilions round about him,
Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death
Dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies
Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem
Through the brightness before him
and all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about
Were coals of fire kindled
Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude
The LORD thundered from heaven,
But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen
And the Most High uttered his voice
Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon
And he sent out arrows, and scattered them;
The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away
Lightning, and discomfited them
And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away
He sent from above, he took me;
And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow
He drew me out of many waters
And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass
They prevented me in the day of my calamity:
The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these
But the LORD was my stay
And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about
He brought me forth also into a large place:
And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door
He delivered me, because he delighted in me
he took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness:
So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah
According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me
And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath
For I have kept the ways of the LORD,
Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land
And have not wickedly departed from my God
in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons
For all his judgments were before me:
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred
And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them
And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison
I was also upright before him,
and spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon
And have kept myself from mine iniquity
and changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful,
The same was in the beginning with God
And with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright
In him was life; and the life was the light of men
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure;
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not
And with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury
There was a man sent from God, whose name was John
For thou art my lamp, O LORD:
He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light
And the LORD will lighten my darkness
He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not
For by thee I have run through a troop:
He came unto his own, and his own received him not
By my God have I leaped over a wall
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name
As for God, his way is perfect;
which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God
The word of the LORD is tried:
And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace
He is a buckler to all them that trust in him
For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ
God is my strength and power:
And they asked him, What then
And he maketh my way perfect
Art thou Elias
He maketh my feet like hinds' feet:
And he saith, I am not
And setteth me upon my high places
Art thou that prophet
Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation:
And they which were sent were of the Pharisees
And thy gentleness hath made me great
These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me;
The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world
So that my feet did not slip
And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him
I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them;
Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples
And turned not again until I had consumed them
And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus
And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise:
and both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage
Yea, they are fallen under my feet
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee
For thou hast girded me with strength to battle:
And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
Them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me
But he spake of the temple of his body
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies,
But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men
That I might destroy them that hate me
Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again
They looked, but there was none to save;
Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things
Even unto the LORD, but he answered them not
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness
Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life
I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved
Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved
Thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen:
For John was not yet cast into prison
A people which I knew not shall serve me
Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying
Strangers shall fade away,
John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven
And they shall be afraid out of their close places
He must increase, but I must decrease
It is God that avengeth me,
He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true
And that bringeth down the people under me
The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand
And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies:
When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John
Thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me:
he left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee
Thou hast delivered me from the violent man
And he must needs go through Samaria
The Spirit of the LORD spake by me,
Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again
And his word was in my tongue
The woman answered and said, I have no husband
The God of Israel said,
Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband
The Rock of Israel spake to me,
The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet
He that ruleth over men must be just,
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father
Ruling in the fear of God
The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men
But the man that shall touch them
Then they went out of the city, and came unto him
Must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear;
Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee
And they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place
This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judæa into Galilee
And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate
After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives
And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years
therefore he would not drink it
And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place
These things did these three mighty men
The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow
And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day
These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men
Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God
Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan
For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will
Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite
that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father
And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer
He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him
then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon
Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live
So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days
For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself
And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men
and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man
For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying
If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true
So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land
There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true
or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee
Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth
or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land
And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me
And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded
Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape
And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground
And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not
And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood
And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life
after he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei
I receive not honour from men
on this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying
But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you
The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount
For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me
turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates
After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias
Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them
And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased
And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone
And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples
the LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude
And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh
How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife
And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do
Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him
So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes
Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten
And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him
And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea
Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it
and entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum
And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do
And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them
And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us
And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew
Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged
(howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)
And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come
They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee
And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe
what dost thou work
and they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out
But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not
And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us
Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves
Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God
It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God
and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us
Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me
Whither shall we go up
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life
our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there
I am that bread of life
Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them
Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead
The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you
and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place
Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day
Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God
For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed
who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day
He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him
And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying
These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum
Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers
What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before
Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither
But there are some of you that believe not
But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it
For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him
Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it
From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him
But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea
Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go
Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us
thou hast the words of eternal life
And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill
Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand
So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill
His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest
And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah
For neither did his brethren believe in him
And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you
When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee
So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews
Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days
Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught
And the LORD spake unto me, saying
If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself
Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward
Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel
And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore
Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill
meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession
Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come
Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink
The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him
For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing
Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him
And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab
will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles
And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink
The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims
(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified
which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims
So there was a division among the people because of him
The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them
And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him
Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered
Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived
And we went over the brook Zered
And every man went unto his own house
And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them
Jesus went unto the mount of Olives
For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed
they say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act
So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people
This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him
that the LORD spake unto me, saying
But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not
Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day
And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground
and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession
And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me
(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims
It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true
a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead
Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself
as he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day
And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world
Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle
Then said they unto him, Who art thou
This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee
And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning
And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying
They understood not that he spake to them of the Father
Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet
As he spake these words, many believed on him
(as the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us
Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed
But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day
Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin
And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land
And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever
Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz
If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed
And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people
Why do ye not understand my speech
And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain
even because ye cannot hear my word
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took
Which of you convinceth me of sin
From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us
And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me
only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us
Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil
Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei
Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death
And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon
Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by
So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth
And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind
All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many
And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes
And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city
Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day
But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves
Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles
And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon
And there was a division among them
(which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind
all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind
For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon
They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us
nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man
And they cast him out
And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites
And he said, Lord, I believe
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber
And I gave Gilead unto Machir
But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep
And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon
And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice
the plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward
This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them
And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them
until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you
The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep
And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest
Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again
Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you
There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings
And I besought the LORD at that time, saying
But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you
O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me
I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon
My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand
But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter
Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him
Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan
Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods
But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see
If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken
So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor
say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God
Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you
If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not
But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day
Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand
Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it
And many believed on him there
For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for
(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick
And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day
Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus
Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons
When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was
specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children
Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day
And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness
If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world
And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice
Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep
And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone
Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead
And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it
Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already
Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire
Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off
lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female
and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother
the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air
Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died
the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth
As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him
But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day
Jesus wept
Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance
Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid
Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee
And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me
For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God
Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him
When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger
But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done
And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you
Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we
And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell
for this man doeth many miracles
But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul
Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death
When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice
Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him
(for the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them
Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this
For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it
But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death
Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live
because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus
Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes
On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem
Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him
The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record
Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire
For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle
And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt
And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast
to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day
Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes
Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else
This he said, signifying what death he should die
Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever
Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you
Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sun rising
Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth
that the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live
While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light
namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites
These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them
And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel
But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him
these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt
Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again
on this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt
These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him
and they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sun rising
for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God
from Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon
Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me
and all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah
And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me
The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb
I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness
The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day
He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day
The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire
he riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself
I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage
After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded
Thou shalt have none other gods before me
If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet
Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth
For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you
and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved
Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee
Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it
Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work
And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou
Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him
And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day
For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor
Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
Little children, yet a little while I am with you
Thou shalt not kill
Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you
Neither shalt thou commit adultery
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also
Neither shalt thou steal
And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son
Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour
If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it
Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's
If ye love me, keep my commandments
And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders
At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you
and ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth
These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you
Now therefore why should we die
Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you
for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die
If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I
For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived
And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe
Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it
I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman
And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you
O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever
Abide in me, and I in you
Go say to them, Get you into your tents again
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me
But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you
Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess
Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples
Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it
If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love
that thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged
This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you
Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends
Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD
Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you
and thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might
These things I command you, that ye love one another
And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart
But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me
and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up
He that hateth me hateth my Father also
And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes
and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning
And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates
These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended
And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not
And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me
and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full
But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them
then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage
And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you
Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name
But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart
Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you
And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment
(for the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth
of sin, because they believe not on me
Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah
of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more
Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee
of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged
And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers
I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now
to cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken
He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you
And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you
All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you
Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand
Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me
and the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes
And in that day ye shall ask me nothing
and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you
And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day
At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you
And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us
His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb
When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou
Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe
and when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them
as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him
neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son
And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent
For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly
I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do
But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire
And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was
but because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt
Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee
Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations
And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves
Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them
I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world
Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil
and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world
Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle
Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth
And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee
And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth
And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee
And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one
If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them
I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me
Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt
O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me
Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed
And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples
Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible
As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground
And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee
Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear
But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed
The servant's name was Malchus
And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them
Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him
All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers
But Peter stood at the door without
And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no
Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter
And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live
One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him
Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years
Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew
Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee
that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die
Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him
For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills
And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe
a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid
When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee
Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified
Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day
And they took Jesus, and led him away
lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene
and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied
Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him
then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage
But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs
who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint
but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end
Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury
and thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid
But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day
There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand
a people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak
Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre
Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee
So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre
Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in
Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people
Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie
Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD
and the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself
Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you
Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed
When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water
For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead
and the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly
Then the disciples went away again unto their own home
And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant
But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre
And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image
and seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain
Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people
And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus
let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they
And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side
So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands
Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord
And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you
And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost
And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes
But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came
And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger
And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book
And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time
There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples
And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount
But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus
And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath
And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes
Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice
As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread
Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you
Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise
I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand
This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead
Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin
And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written
lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness
The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel
Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm
Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation
At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood
Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth
And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark
The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn
And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand
Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God
And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me
The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered
And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead
O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field
From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters
The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness
Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him
The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run
And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee
Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness
And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them
They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief
to keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good
The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining
Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is
Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God
Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked
Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly
he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment
Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people
Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt
Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things
Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name
and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit
He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen
And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke
Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude
The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come
Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway
For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem
and his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land
And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink
and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day
Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine
and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place
will ye render me a recompence
and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel
and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head
but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did
because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things
Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it
the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border
and that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey
Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head
For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs
and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken it
but the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven
Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about
a land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year
The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining
And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul
But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation
that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil
For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwelleth in Zion
And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full
Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying
Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them
But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken
and then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you
And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us
Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes
So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah
And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up
Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this
And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates
For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them
that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth
Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them
For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him
So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging
then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves
Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows
There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you
Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah
Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse
And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights
a blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day
Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly
and a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known
I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD,
And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal
And he heard me;
Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh
Out of the belly of hell cried I,
And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day
And thou heardest my voice
These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth
The waters compassed me about, even to the soul:
Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree
The depth closed me round about,
and ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place
The weeds were wrapped about my head
Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God
When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD:
But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come
And my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple
and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks
They that observe lying vanities
and there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee
Forsake their own mercy
Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes
But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving;
For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you
I will pay that that I have vowed
then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD
Salvation is of the LORD
and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you
And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land
Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest
And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying
but in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee
So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD
Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart
Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey
Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water
And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown
Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand
For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes
but thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto
Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not
Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth
And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not
When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after
But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry
If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after
Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry
Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike
So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city
Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh
But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered
Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water
And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live
Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD
And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd
Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose
And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death
and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh
and should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle
Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God
Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called
When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land
mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied
take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods
And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day
even so will I do likewise
Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities
Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods
But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ
What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it
And of some have compassion, making a difference
If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder
Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy
and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them
He hath led me, and brought me
Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him
Into darkness, but not into light
namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth
It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed,
thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him
Because his compassions fail not
And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage
He putteth his mouth in the dust;
If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying
If so be there may be hope
Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known
O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong:
And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again
Judge thou my cause
And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers
Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us:
when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God
Consider, and behold our reproach
Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead
Our inheritance is turned to strangers,
Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing
Our houses to aliens
These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat
We are orphans and fatherless,
the hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois
Our mothers are as widows
And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat
Our fathers have sinned, and are not;
Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you
And we have borne their iniquities
And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase
We gat our bread with the peril of our lives
These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat
Because of the sword of the wilderness
and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you
Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,
Of all clean birds ye shall eat
And forsake us so long time
But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray
But thou hast utterly rejected us;
and the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind
Thou art very wroth against us
and every raven after his kind
Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us
and the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind
it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus
the little owl, and the great owl, and the swan
that thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed
and the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant
And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless
and the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat
And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course
And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten
And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense
But of all clean fowls ye may eat
And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense
Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year
And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him
And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always
And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth
And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee
And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God
then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose
And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this
and thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household
And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house
and the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee
And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying
At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates
And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth
and the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest
And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be
At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release
And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God
And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release
And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word
Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release
And the angel departed from her
save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it
And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda
only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day
and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth
For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee
And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me
If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother
For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy
but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth
And Mary said,
Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto
My soul doth magnify the Lord
For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour
And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee
For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden:
And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty
For, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed
thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day
And holy is his name
And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee
And his mercy is on them that fear him
Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household
From generation to generation
And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God
He hath shewed strength with his arm;
Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart
He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts
Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water
He hath put down the mighty from their seats,
Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night
And exalted them of low degree
Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there
He hath filled the hungry with good things;
Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life
And the rich he hath sent empty away
And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning
He hath holpen his servant Israel,
Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
In remembrance of his mercy
but at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt
Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son
And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents
And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her
Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work therein
And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called
Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn
And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God
And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee
And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judæa
and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there
And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes
And the hand of the Lord was with him
Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine
And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying
and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel;
Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice
For he hath visited and redeemed his people
Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty
And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us
every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee
In the house of his servant David
Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment
As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began
Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous
That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us
That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
To perform the mercy promised to our fathers,
Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee
And to remember his holy covenant
Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God hateth
The oath which he sware to our father Abraham
Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an abomination unto the LORD thy God
That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies
If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant
Might serve him without fear
and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded
And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:
and it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel
For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways
then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die
To give knowledge of salvation unto his people
At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death
By the remission of their sins
The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people
And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed
So thou shalt put the evil away from among you
And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city
If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose
And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)
and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment
to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child
and thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee
And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered
according to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night
And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously
And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people
When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord
thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother
And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child
But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way
And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds
Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold
But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart
And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites
And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them
and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them
And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb
that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel
And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ
The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance
then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said
Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them
Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,
And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw
According to thy word
The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him
For mine eyes have seen thy salvation
For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever
Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people
And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose
And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him
then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD
And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth
They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony
Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover
There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch
And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast
or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer
And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it
For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee
And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers
Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God
And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them
For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do
as it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying,
The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken
The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
according to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not
Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken
Make his paths straight
And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him
Every valley shall be filled,
But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die
And every mountain and hill shall be brought low;
And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken
And the crooked shall be made straight,
When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses
And the rough ways shall be made smooth
thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it
And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people
Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither
But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done
And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past
added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison
as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live
And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past
And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time
Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee
And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season
And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers
And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all
if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three
And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias
that innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee
And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written
But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die
Because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor;
Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee
He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives,
Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it
And recovering of sight to the blind,
One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established
To set at liberty them that are bruised
If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong
And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down
then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days
And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him
and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother
And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country
then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you
And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath
And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you
And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong
And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot
But he passing through the midst of them went his way
When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt
And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power
And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people
And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice
for the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you
And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this
And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it
And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about
let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it
And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house
And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it
And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her
let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it
And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee
And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her
And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret
let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her
and saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets
And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted
And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land
let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart
And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship
And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people
And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake
When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it
For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken
And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee
And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him
And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it
And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean
and when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword
And immediately the leprosy departed from him
but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee
And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed
Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations
But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts
But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth
Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk
but thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee
And he left all, rose up, and followed him
that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God
And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them
When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege
But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved
only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued
And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands
If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath slain him
But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst
then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain
And he arose and stood forth
and it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke
Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley
And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand
and the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried
And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other
and all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley
And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus
and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it
Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew
Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge
Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphæus, and Simon called Zelotes
And the blood shall be forgiven them
and Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor
So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD
and they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed
When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive
And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all
and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife
Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake
then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails
But woe unto you that are rich
And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her
for ye have received your consolation
If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be her's that was hated
Woe unto you that are full
then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn
for ye shall hunger
If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them
Woe unto you that laugh now
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place
for ye shall mourn and weep
and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you
And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear
bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you
And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree
And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise
his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance
For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye
Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother
for sinners also love those that love them
And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again
And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye
Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again
for sinners also do even the same
The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God
And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye
If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young
for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again
but thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days
Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful
When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye
Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled
Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye
Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together
Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye
Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together
And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say
Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself
Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like
If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her
Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum
then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate
And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die
and the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her
And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant
And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him
And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people
But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel
And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak
If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel
And he delivered him to his mother
If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her
And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judæa, and throughout all the region round about
then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you
And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things
But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die
And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come
for he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her
When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come
If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found
And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight
then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days
Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached
A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his father's skirt
And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see
He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD
A reed shaken with the wind
A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD
But what went ye out for to see
An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever
A man clothed in soft raiment
because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee
Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts
Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee
And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John
Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever
But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him
Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land
The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners
The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation
And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him
When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing
And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat
If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp
And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman
but it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again
I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head
Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad
Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet
and thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee
My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment
for the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee
And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable
Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee
And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it
he shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him
Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God
There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel
Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved
Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God
For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad
Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury
Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press
unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it
And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them
When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee
And he suffered them
But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee
When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country
That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth
They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed
When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel
Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear; and he went up into the ship, and returned back again
When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn
Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee
When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house
And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him
And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife
for he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying
And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife
But as he went the people thronged him
When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken
And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately

And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead
Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt
Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases
When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge
And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick
Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee
And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart
And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge
And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead
Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates
And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things
at his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee
And he desired to see him
The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin
And they did so, and made them all sit down

Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do
But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God
Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel
And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich
your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water
And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God
that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day
And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake
that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob
And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken
Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath
And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho
but with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day
And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way
(for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by
And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham
and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)
He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return
lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood
And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant
the LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven
Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow
And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law
And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds
so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it
(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds
and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath
And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem
Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt
And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples
and the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book
And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them
and the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day
And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way
The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law
saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace
And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee
but now they are hid from thine eyes
and shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul
And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought
If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee
And he taught daily in the temple
and the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers
But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him
And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live
and could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him
And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee
and spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things
And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day
And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty
And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers
So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul
What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them
For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off
And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written,
It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it
The stone which the builders rejected,
Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it
The same is become the head of the corner
But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it
Last of all the woman died also
See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil
And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage
in that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it
but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage
But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them
And after that they durst not ask him any question at all
I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it
And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son
that thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them
Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples
And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel
And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury
And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan
And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites
The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said
And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all
And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed
And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be
And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you
Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom
And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it
And it shall turn to you for a testimony
And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel
Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer
And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles
for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist
when all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing
And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death
Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake
and that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it
But there shall not an hair of your head perish
And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle
And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh
And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them
Then let them which are in Judæa flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto
And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods
For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled
Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel
But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days
For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant
for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people
Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel
men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken
And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished
And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees
that Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying
when they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand
Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled
For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death
Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away
Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them
Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover
For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands
And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people
And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended
Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve
Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak;
And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them
And hear, O earth, the words of my mouth
And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money
My doctrine shall drop as the rain,
Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed
My speech shall distil as the dew,
And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him
As the small rain upon the tender herb,
And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer
And as the showers upon the grass
And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves
Because I will publish the name of the LORD:
But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table
Ascribe ye greatness unto our God
And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest
They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children:
For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth
They are a perverse and crooked generation
is not he that sitteth at meat
Do ye thus requite the LORD,
but I am among you as he that serveth
O foolish people and unwise
Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations
Is not he thy father that hath bought thee
And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me
Hath he not made thee, and established thee
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel
For the LORD's portion is his people;
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed
Jacob is the lot of his inheritance
And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him
He found him in a desert land,
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground
And in the waste howling wilderness;
And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow
He led him about, he instructed him,
And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear
He kept him as the apple of his eye
And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far
As an eagle stirreth up her nest,
And he touched his ear, and healed him
Fluttereth over her young,
Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves
Spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,
Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house
Beareth them on her wings
And Peter followed afar off
So the LORD alone did lead him,
And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest
And there was no strange god with him
And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew
He made him ride on the high places of the earth,
And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter
That he might eat the increase of the fields;
And Peter went out, and wept bitterly
And he made him to suck honey out of the rock,
And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him
And oil out of the flinty rock
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him
Butter of kine, and milk of sheep,
Art thou the Christ
With fat of lambs,
And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe
And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,
and if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go
With the fat of kidneys of wheat;
And they said, What need we any further witness
And thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape
And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him
But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked:
Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing
Thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness;
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him
Then he forsook God which made him,
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves
And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation
And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people
Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful,
Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them
And hast forgotten God that formed thee
And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified
And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them,
And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed
Because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required
And he said, I will hide my face from them,
And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death
I will see what their end shall be:
And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS
For they are a very froward generation,
And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour
Children in whom is no faith
And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst
For a fire is kindled in mine anger,
And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned
And shall burn unto the lowest hell,
And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things
And shall consume the earth with her increase,
And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just
And set on fire the foundations of the mountains
This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus
I will heap mischiefs upon them;
Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them
I will spend mine arrows upon them
And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre
I said, I would scatter them into corners,
And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus
I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men
And they remembered his words
Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy,
and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest
Lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely,
It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles
And lest they should say, Our hand is high,
And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not
And the LORD hath not done all this
And they talked together of all these things which had happened
For they are a nation void of counsel,
And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them
Neither is there any understanding in them
But their eyes were holden that they should not know him
O that they were wise, that they understood this,
Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken
That they would consider their latter end
And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself
For their rock is not as our Rock,
And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further
Even our enemies themselves being judges
But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent
For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,
And he went in to tarry with them
And of the fields of Gomorrah:
And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread
Their grapes are grapes of gall,
But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit
Their clusters are bitter
And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet
Their wine is the poison of dragons,
And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb
And the cruel venom of asps
And he took it, and did eat before them
Is not this laid up in store with me,
Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures
And sealed up among my treasures
and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day
For the LORD shall judge his people,
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem
And repent himself for his servants,
And ye are witnesses of these things
When he seeth that their power is gone,
And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them
And there is none shut up, or left
And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven
And he shall say, Where are their gods,
The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi
Their rock in whom they trusted
And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil
Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices,
and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil
And drank the wine of their drink offerings
offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person
Let them rise up and help you,
saith the LORD of hosts
And be your protection
And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons
See now that I, even I, am he,
saith the LORD of hosts
And there is no god with me:
And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you
I kill, and I make alive;
If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart
I wound, and I heal:
Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it
Neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand
My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name
For I lift up my hand to heaven,
The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity
And say, I live for ever
For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts
If I whet my glittering sword,
Have we not all one father
And mine hand take hold on judgment;
hath not one God created us
I will render vengeance to mine enemies,
why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers
And will reward them that hate me
Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god
I will make mine arrows drunk with blood,
The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts
And my sword shall devour flesh;
And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand
And that with the blood of the slain and of the captives,
Ye have wearied the LORD with your words
From the beginning of revenges upon the enemy
Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him
And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun
But who may abide the day of his coming
And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel
and who shall stand when he appeareth
and he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law
for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap
For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it
and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness
And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying
Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years
Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession
And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts
and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people
For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed
because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel
Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them
Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel
Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts
And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death
But ye said, Wherein shall we return
The LORD came from Sinai,
Will a man rob God
And rose up from Seir unto them;
Yet ye have robbed me
He shined forth from mount Paran,
But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee
And he came with ten thousands of saints:
In tithes and offerings
From his right hand went a fiery law for them
Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation
Yea, he loved the people;
Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it
All his saints are in thy hand:
And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts
And they sat down at thy feet;
Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts
Every one shall receive of thy words
Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name
And he was king in Jeshurun,
But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall
When the heads of the people
Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments
And the tribes of Israel were gathered together
Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD
And of Levi he said,
Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren
Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one,
and Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram
Whom thou didst prove at Massah,
and Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon
And with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah
and Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa
They shall teach Jacob thy judgments,
and Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias
And Israel thy law:
and Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias
They shall put incense before thee,
and Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias
And whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar
and after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel
And of Benjamin he said,
and Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor
The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him;
and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud
And the LORD shall cover him all the day long,
and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob
And he shall dwell between his shoulders
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations
And of Joseph he said,
But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
Blessed of the LORD be his land,
Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying
For the precious things of heaven, for the dew,
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
And for the deep that coucheth beneath
And they shall call his name Emmanuel,
And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun,
which being interpreted is, God with us
And for the precious things put forth by the moon
Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife
And for the chief things of the ancient mountains,
And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born
And for the precious things of the lasting hills
And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judæa: for thus it is written by the prophet
And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof,
Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared
And for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush:
When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt
Let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph,
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying
And upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren
But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
And of Zebulun he said,
And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel
Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;
Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judæa, and all the region round about Jordan
And, Issachar, in thy tents
and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins
And of Gad he said,
Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance
Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad:
Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him
He dwelleth as a lion,
And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness
And teareth the arm with the crown of the head
Then he suffered him
And he provided the first part for himself,
And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him
Because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated;
Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil
And he came with the heads of the people,
And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred
He executed the justice of the LORD,
Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple
And his judgments with Israel
Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them
And of Dan he said,
Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him
Dan is a lion's whelp:
Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee
He shall leap from Bashan
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying
And of Naphtali he said,
The people which sat in darkness
O Naphtali, satisfied with favour,
Saw great light;
And full with the blessing of the LORD:
And to them which sat in the region and shadow of death
Possess thou the west and the south
And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers
And of Asher he said,
And they straightway left their nets, and followed him
Let Asher be blessed with children;
And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him
Let him be acceptable to his brethren,
And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them
And let him dip his foot in oil
And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judæa, and from beyond Jordan
Thy shoes shall be iron and brass;
And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him
And as thy days, so shall thy strength be
and he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying
There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun,
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake
Who rideth upon the heaven in thy help,
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven
And in his excellency on the sky
For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled
The eternal God is thy refuge,
but I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire
And underneath are the everlasting arms:
Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee
And he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee;
leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift
And shall say, Destroy them
Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison
and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea
Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing
and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar
but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart
So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD
And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day
And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black
And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended
but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also
And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses
And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also
And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face
And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain
in all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land
Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away
and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you
The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem
For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye
I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem
do not even the publicans the same
And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith
And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit
do not even the publicans so
And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit
Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect
I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it
Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven
I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life
Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men
I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards
Verily I say unto you, They have their reward
I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits
But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth
I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees
that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly
I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men
So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me
Verily I say unto you, They have their reward
And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour
But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking
And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king
Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him
even that which hath been already done
Thy kingdom come
Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven
For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten
Give us this day our daily bread
as the fool
For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you
Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit
but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses
Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me
But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face
Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal
For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal
For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night
Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on
This is also vanity
Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment
There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour
Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them
This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God
Are ye not much better than they
For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I
and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith
What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you
I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it
Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself
I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof
And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God
For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again
I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye
I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts
Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye
For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity
Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone
All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again
Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent
Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth
If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him
Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him
because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it
Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive
Ye shall know them by their fruits
Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun
Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles
Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour
Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit
This is also vanity and vexation of spirit
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire
Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them
Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun
Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock
Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour
and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock
For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up
And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand
Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone
And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine
And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes
Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished
When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him
For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor
And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean
I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead
And immediately his leprosy was cleansed
There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him
The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed
Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit
And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven
For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words
And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee
Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay
And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour
For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God
And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever
If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they
And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them
Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field
Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side
Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion
And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him
Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God
And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding
For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart
And he said unto them, Go
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men
And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters
If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he
And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils
For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness
And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts
Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other
And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city
All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled
And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts
Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better
And he arose, and departed to his house
For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow
But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick
for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun
And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them
A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth
but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast
It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart
And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples
Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better
And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth
But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole
Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart
And the woman was made whole from that hour
Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit
And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools
he said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth
Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time
And they laughed him to scorn
Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city
And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land
For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not
But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country
Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee
As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil
All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me
But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd
That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out
Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few
I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness
And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease
Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account
Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphæus, and Lebbæus, whose surname was Thaddæus
which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found
Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him
Who is as the wise man
These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not
and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing
but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel
a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed
Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses
I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God
nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat
Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou
And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence
Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment
And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you
Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him
And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet
For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be
Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city
There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it
But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues
All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt
But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil
For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you
Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord
but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God
If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household
Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun
Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known
then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing
All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath
and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father
For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered
Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun
Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows
Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment
Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven
Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun
But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest
And a man's foes shall be they of his own household
For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them
And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me
This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me
He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
there was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it
And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities
now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man
Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see
The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools
the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them
Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good
And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see
Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour
A reed shaken with the wind
A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left
But what went ye out for to see
Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool
A man clothed in soft raiment
If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences
behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses
folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place
Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth
And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force
He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear
Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby
Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not
If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct
But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you
Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better
Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight
The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest
The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls
A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him
At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat
The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city
But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple
Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning
And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue
Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness
And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out
By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through
How much then is a man better than a sheep
A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things
Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand
Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter
And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other
Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days
Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth
But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all
If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be
and charged them that they should not make him known
He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying
As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all
He shall not strive, nor cry;
In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good
Neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets
Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun
and if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment
Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man
Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity
and then he will spoil his house
Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them
He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad
while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain
O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened
for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh
and the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low
But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment
also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets
for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern
The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here
Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity
The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here
The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none
The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd
But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother
And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh
And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man
The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side
Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore
that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace
And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow
in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him
and when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up
when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days
and when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away
And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace
but other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold
where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble
He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given
And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king
Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand
And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure
And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith,
Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus
By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand;
to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on
And seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive
But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him
But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear
Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment
For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them
and the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)
Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower
what shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains
When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart
And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus
This is he which received seed by the way side
For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not
But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it
And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small
yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended
And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan
Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field
for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people
but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way
After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her
But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also
Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king
So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field
and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them
But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them
and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti
Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field
And the thing pleased the king; and he did so
All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them
Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite
He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away
As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world
So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women
The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity
Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it
and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father
then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house
Who hath ears to hear, let him hear
Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls
And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her
who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it
So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind
And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti
But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod
And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate
And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick
Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him
And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children
In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus
And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away
After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea
And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath
And he said, Come
And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai
And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus
And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them
And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased
And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy
And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret
And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee
And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased
And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey
Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders
The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day
But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition
When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry
But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me
and came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth
and honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free
And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes
Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition
So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her
Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying
Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not
This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips;
Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was
But their heart is far from me
So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate
And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand
And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them
But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up
Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people
And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding
And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai
Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught
Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man
And they told to Mordecai Esther's words
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies
Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews
Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon
Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer
And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there
So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him
insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel
Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground
And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him
And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude
Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is
And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full
if I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said
And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children
And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king
And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala
Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate
He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red
On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king
And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring
And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus
O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times
And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this
Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread
Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him
Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ
And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me
let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head
For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul
And Mordecai came again to the king's gate
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered
And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart
And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared
and was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light
So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen
And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him
And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther
And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid
and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request
And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only
and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things
Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request
Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist
for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish
Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water
But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage
Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you
Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was
how long shall I suffer you
Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house
bring him hither to me
As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face
Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting
And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman
And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men
Then the king said, Hang him thereon
Peter saith unto him, Of strangers
So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai
Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free
Then was the king's wrath pacified
And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them
And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews
Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther
And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me
So Esther arose, and stood before the king
But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea
and said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost
for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people
And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray
or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred
Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish
Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews
But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries
Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven
wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey
Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants
upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar
And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents
The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies
And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt
So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment
So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done
And the decree was given at Shushan the palace
And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him
And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day
And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judæa beyond Jordan
And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them
And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there
Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)
Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them
the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people
And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence
And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them
He saith unto him, Which
For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater
Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness
Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven
And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men
And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel
And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha
And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life
and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha
For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard
On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king
And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows
and said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you
And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons
And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny
For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand
But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny
But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey
Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee
on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness
Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own
But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness
And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them
Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another
And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren
And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far
But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them
to stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly
And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him
And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them
All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying
but when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows
And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them
Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them
Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them
And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there
the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year
Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered
and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed
and when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it
Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim
And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another
And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth
Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise
to confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry
And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him
And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book
And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them
And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea
And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said
And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son
Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob
and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah
and the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin
But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city
Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher
And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment
And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already
and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment
And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation
And he was speechless
And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them
But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites
Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph
Shew me the tribute money
And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we
And they brought unto him a penny
come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land
When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way
And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour
And last of all the woman died also
And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven
and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live
Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God
But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven
And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive
But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying
Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty
And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine
And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses
Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying
And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive
This is the first and great commandment
And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them
And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months
He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying
And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink
The LORD said unto my Lord,
And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him
Sit thou on my right hand,
And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it
And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions
Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee
Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples
And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go
saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat
And the maid went and called the child's mother
For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers
And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages
and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues
And the woman took the child, and nursed it
and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi
And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand
But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren
And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow
And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven
And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us
Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ
intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian
But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant
And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known
But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites
Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock
for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in
And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites
And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day
for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves
And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock
Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon
And he said unto his daughters, And where is he
And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein
why is it that ye have left the man
And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon
call him, that he may eat bread
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites
And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land
for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess
And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage
Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also
And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites
And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them
for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness
Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb
Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt
Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets
And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers
And he said, Here am I
Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell
And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground
that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar
Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation
And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate
And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows
And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple
and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be
Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you
Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt
All these are the beginning of sorrows
And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt
And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another
And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain
And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many
And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name
But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved
what shall I say unto them
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come
And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you
then let them which be in Judæa flee into the mountains
Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt
let him which is on the house top not come down to take any thing out of his house
and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey
And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days
And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand
Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not
And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go
Behold, I have told you before
And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty
Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not
And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee
For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be
And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand
For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together
And he said, A rod
Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken
And he said, Cast it on the ground
and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it
And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other
And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled
And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away
that they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee
But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be
And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign
For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark
And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land
Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left
And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth
Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come
or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind
Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing
have not I the LORD
Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods
Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say
But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming
And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God
and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs
And five of them were wise, and five were foolish
And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive
They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them
And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps
And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept
And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go
Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps
And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn
For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods
And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him
Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents
Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me
And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two
And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses
But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money
And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him
After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them
And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him
Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed
And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel
His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed
and Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people
When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory
And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped
and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats
And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness
and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left
And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works
Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
get you unto your burdens
for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in
And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens
Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee
And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying
or thirsty, and gave thee drink
Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves
When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in
Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words
or naked, and clothed thee
And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw
for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink
Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples
So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw
Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas
And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw
and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him
And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore
Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper
Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants
But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste
Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks
When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman
And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task
for she hath wrought a good work upon me
And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh
For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always
And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people
For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial
why is it that thou hast sent me
Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests
Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land
and said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you
And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD
And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver
and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them
And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him
And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover
Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments
Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve
and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians
And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me
And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD
And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it
And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage
And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee
Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land
Likewise also said all the disciples
And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips
And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour
And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri
And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy
And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri
And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words
And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar
And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come
And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites
Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him
These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies
And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear
These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels
And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me
that the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee
I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me
And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me
But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled
And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet
Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled
Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land
Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death
And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt
but found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none
But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments
At the last came two false witnesses
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them
Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands
And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they
Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man
And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh
And immediately the cock crew
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice
When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent
And he went out, and wept bitterly
Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments
When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death
For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods
and when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor
And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said
Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders
And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go
saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood
Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand
And they said, What is that to us
And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear
And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself
Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood
Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day
And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value
And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone
And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing
And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt
And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly
And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said
Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would
And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also
Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you
And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him
And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus
And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me
Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified
And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers
and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs
And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe
and the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants
And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head
And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt
And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull
And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt
And sitting down they watched him there
And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt
Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD
And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads
And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only
He saved others; himself he cannot save
And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only
If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him
And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh
The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth
And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour
And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani
But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said
And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink
And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt
Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost
And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast
and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose
Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said
and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many
And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me
among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children
Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are
When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathæa, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple
And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth
And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth
And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies
And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre
And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land
In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre
We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us
His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow
And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD
And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified
And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one
He is not here: for he is risen, as he said
And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go
Come, see the place where the Lord lay
Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me
And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail
For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still
And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him
behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain
Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done
And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel
And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers
And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land
saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept
And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one
And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost
And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go
The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem
And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt
For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth
And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast
And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place
And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians
For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel
And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me
What is the transgression of Jacob
For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth
is it not Samaria
For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth
and what are the high places of Judah
And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth
are they not Jerusalem
As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go
Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof
Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now
For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem
He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses
Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee
and he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field
Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt
when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand
So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation
Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD
And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field
Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war
Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail
The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever
And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked
If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people
Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer
I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men
And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's
The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them
But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God
Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones
And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled
who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron
But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up
Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings
And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth
Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him
And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants
But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin
And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses
Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him
They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity
and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD
And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more
And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me
But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it
let my people go, that they may serve me
For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever
Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast
and I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever
and they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field
And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem
and they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day
Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion
And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh
But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor
And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go
Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek
And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD
But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting
Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire
Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel
And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence
And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left
And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you
And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men
Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only
And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver
And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD
Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off
And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go
and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt
And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities
And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days
Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice
And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you
O my people, what have I done unto thee
And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God
and wherein have I wearied thee
Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither
testify against me
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go
For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam
And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more
O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD
Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold
Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God
And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt
shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts
Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil
And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more
shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul
But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel
He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God
And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt
Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable
And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land
Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying
For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth
This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you
Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins
and if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb
Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening
For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people
And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it
Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom
And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it
Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me
Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof
Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me
And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire
I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness
And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover
Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God
For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD
mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets
And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever
In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed
Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel
In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain
And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever
Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even
Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old
Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land
According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things
Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread
The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf
And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning
They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee
For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you
He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea
And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever
Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old
And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God
And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service
John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins
That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses
And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan
And the people bowed the head and worshipped
And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him
And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they
And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness
And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle
Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God
And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead
Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers
And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said
And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him
Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also
And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him
And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders
And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes
And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children
And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him
And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle
And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this
Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years
what new doctrine is this
And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt

A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof

And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath
Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD

Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters
And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him
And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt
For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues
And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt

and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphæus, and Thaddæus, and Simon the Canaanite

that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage
And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan
and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem
And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand
And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt
And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand
And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt

And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night
And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren
he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people
and it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
but when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away
Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea
And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable
For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in
And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable
And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD
and how then will ye know all parables
And they did so
The sower soweth the word
And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us
And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed
And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him
and not to be set on a candlestick
and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them
For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad
And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand
And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground
But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon
and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how
And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD
It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth
And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness
And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it
wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt
But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples
And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever
And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still
The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace
And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm
And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me
And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes
speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward
And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit
but lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea
And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones
And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen
But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen
Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding
And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them
And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country
and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night
And they went out to see what it was that was done
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided
And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine
And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left
And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts
And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen
And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him
And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians
And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen
And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years
And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea
and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse
And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them
when she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment
But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left
And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing
Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore
But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth
And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses
And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James
Who is like thee, glorious in holiness,
And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly
Fearful in praises, doing wonders
And they laughed him to scorn
The people shall hear, and be afraid:
But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying

And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him
The LORD shall reign for ever and ever
And he marvelled because of their unbelief
And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances
And he went round about the villages, teaching
So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water
And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place
And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink
And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them
and said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee
And they went out, and preached that men should repent
And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters
Others said, That it is Elias
And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt
And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets
And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness
Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not
And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily
And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb
And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt
And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught
and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us
And they departed into a desert place by ship privately
And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings
And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed
And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud
And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties
And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host
And they did all eat, and were filled
And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground
And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes
This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents
And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men
And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less
And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people
And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating
And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray
And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning
But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out
And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted
And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore
And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning
And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him
And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein
And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault
And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field
For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders
Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none
He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written,
And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none
This people honoureth me with their lips,
And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws
But their heart is far from me
So the people rested on the seventh day
For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do
And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey
And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition
And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt
but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free
And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations
And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother
As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept
And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand
And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan
And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable
And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink
And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also
Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink
Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him
And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me
And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man
wherefore do ye tempt the LORD
For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders
And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst
thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness
And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people
And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed
they be almost ready to stone me
And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go
And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain
Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink
I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat
And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel
So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets
And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not
And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha
Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim
And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side
And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand
Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf
So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill
Having eyes, see ye not
And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed
and having ears, hear ye not
But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun
and do ye not remember
And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword
And he charged them that they should tell no man of him
And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul
And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi
Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
for he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation
And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power
When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt
And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them
then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back
And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus
and her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land
For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid
and the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh
And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves
and Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God
And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him
and he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her
And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him
And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them
And he said, Of a child
And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians
But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose
Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them
And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it
And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God
But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him
And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening
But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me
And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people
For he that is not against us is on our part
why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even
For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward
And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God
And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea
when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws
where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched
And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good
where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched
Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone
where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched
and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do
For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt
Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens
And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept
If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace
For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife
So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said
And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter
And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens
And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her
And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land
But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God
In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai
And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them
For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount
And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good
And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel
there is none good but one, that is, God
ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself
And the disciples were astonished at his words
And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him
But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes
And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's
and be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai
but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared
And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death
And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John
And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes
and whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all
And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives
And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus
And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled
And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole
And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount
And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way
And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly
And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry
And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice
and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple
And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up
And when even was come, he went out of the city
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish
And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots
And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them
And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God
And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it
Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them
And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them
And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses
So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them
And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders
And God spake all these words, saying
and say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things
I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage
And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard
Thou shalt have no other gods before me
And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth
And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled
thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me
And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard
and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments
What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others
Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy
And have ye not read this scripture;
Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work
The stone which the builders rejected
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates
Is become the head of the corner
for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it
This was the Lord's doing,
Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words
Thou shalt not kill
In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them
Thou shalt not steal
And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour
For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's
And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is , Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord
And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off
And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God
And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die
And no man after that durst ask him any question
And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not
And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David
And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was
For David himself said by the Holy Ghost,
And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven
The LORD said to my Lord,
Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold
Sit thou on my right hand,
An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee
David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son
And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it
And the common people heard him gladly
Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon
and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts
Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them
And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing
If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him
And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury
If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself
Tell us, when shall these things be
And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free
And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you
then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever
And the gospel must first be published among all nations
And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do
But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost
If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her
and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house
And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters
and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment
If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish
But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days
And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money
And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter
He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death
And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not
And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death
But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things
And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death
and the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken
And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory
And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed
And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven
And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished
Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done
Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money
Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away
If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine
Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is
And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life
Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning
eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot
lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping
burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe
After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death
And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake
And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made
And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake
And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her
If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit
she hath wrought a good work on me
But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death
And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them
If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him
And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money
Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him
And he sought how he might conveniently betray him
If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned
And in the evening he cometh with the twelve
And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein
And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish
the owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his
And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many
And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide
And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives
Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own
And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him
If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep
And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou
If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him
couldest not thou watch one hour
If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double
And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words
If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution
And they laid their hands on him, and took him
If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution
And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear
If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me
If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods
And they all forsook him, and fled
For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour
And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him
If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it
and he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked
then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good
For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together
And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof
And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying
If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn
But neither so did their witness agree together
And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good
And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing
But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire
And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest
And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife
But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest
If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins
And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live
And the second time the cock crew
Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death
And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice
He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed
And when he thought thereon, he wept
Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt
And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing
Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child
And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing
If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry
But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled
and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless
Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired
If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury
And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them
If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy
Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people
But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them
Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me
And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Prætorium; and they call together the whole band
Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me
And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head
And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs
And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him
Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness
And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull
Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment
And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not
neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause
And it was the third hour, and they crucified him
If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again
And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left
If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him
And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days
Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause
Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save
Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked
Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe
And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous
And they that were crucified with him reviled him
Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt
And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour
And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani
but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat
And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost
In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard
And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom
Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed
And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph
And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth
And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him
Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year
And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun
Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)
And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted
and the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field
And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept
Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD
And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning
And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them
Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared
And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature
Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him
And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues
But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries
So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God
For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off
And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following
Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images
The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein
And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee
Who can stand before his indignation
There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil
and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger
I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee
his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him
And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee
The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him
I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee
But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies
By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land
For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry
And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee
There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor
Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods
Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through
They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee
Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more
And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off
For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder
And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him
Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace
And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do
O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off
And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel
He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily
And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD
For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches
And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar
The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken
And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient
The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings
And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words
He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared
Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel
The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved
and they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness
And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts
And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink
Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture
And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them
She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness
And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God
Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid
And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount
The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin
And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud
Woe to the bloody city
And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel
it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departeth not
And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights
the noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame
Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering
And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock
And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass
Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy
and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair
All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater
and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood
There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts
oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense
Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away
onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate
Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are
And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them
There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually
According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it
Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD
And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof
And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about
For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever
And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it
In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them
And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold
Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity
And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them
neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress
The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it
For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head
And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee
For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been
And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof
But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions
And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat
And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it
And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be
And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead
And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee
And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's
And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel
grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof
I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about
hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints
And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about
For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother
And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof
whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels
Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table
If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself
And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them
There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus
And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them
grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ
And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you
And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same
always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy
And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side
for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now
three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick
being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers
For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ
And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick
so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places
Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold
and many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear
And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it
For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold
For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain
Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels
nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you
And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount
And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith
Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them
that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again
The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of the curtains shall have one measure
If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies
The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another
fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind
And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the coupling of the second
Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others
Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one of another
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus
And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one tabernacle
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure
And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make
Do all things without murmurings and disputings
The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure
holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain
And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle
For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me
And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second
For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's
And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one
But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel
And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle
Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me
And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it
But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly
And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins
I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful
And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up
Though I might also have confidence in the flesh
Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board
If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more
Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle
concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless
And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward
if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead
And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons
Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing
And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side there shall be twenty boards
Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample
and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board
For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ
And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards
who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself
And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides
I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord
And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners
Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things
And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board
Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you
And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle
Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only
and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two sides westward
For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity
And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus
And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold
Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever
And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was shewed thee in the mount
Salute every saint in Christ Jesus
And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made
The brethren which are with me greet you
and thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the four sockets of silver
who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw
And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy
and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth
And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy place
Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood
And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on the north side
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me
And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework
And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks
And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them
His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire
And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits
and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters
And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt overlay it with brass
And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead
And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof
And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last
And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath, that the net may be even to the midst of the altar
Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter
And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with brass
Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks
And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it
and hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted
Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee in the mount, so shall they make it
Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love
and the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall be of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver
But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate

All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass
And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations
In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father
And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons
And I will give him the morning star
And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty
Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent
And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office
If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee
And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office
So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth

And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD
And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ
And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven
And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons
If any man have an ear, let him hear
and it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD
And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men
And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them
and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live
And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place
And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed
And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads
And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy
And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads
And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy
And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps
And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them
These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins
And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it
These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth
Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy
These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb
Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually
And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God
The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even
And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand
And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD
Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus
This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee
And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped
And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory
And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle
And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office
And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened
And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God
and the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles
And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God
And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever
And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it
And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about
And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire
And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal
And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared
And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold
And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet
And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee
And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon
And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it
And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great
And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations
And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found
Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon
And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication
When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them
And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel
This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD
I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns
Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD
And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition
The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls
And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast
And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls
These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues
Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein
And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire
For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat
For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled
when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD
And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory
so they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations
And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning
Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more
Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels
the merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble
And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony
and cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men
and the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense
The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing
and the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot
and saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls
And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy
For in one hour so great riches is come to nought
And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office
And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations
And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness
Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you
And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all
Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people
And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee
And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD
And again they said, Alleluia
Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people
And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army
See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah
And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison
and I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire
to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass
This is the second death
and in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship
And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
the tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle
And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
and the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense
He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son
and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot
And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God
and the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office
on the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof
Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you
And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones
Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant
The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald
And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God
the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst
And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him
And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it
And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me
And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof
And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron
And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there
And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt
And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it
And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play
and they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves
And I John saw these things, and heard them
And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people
And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things
now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation
And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand
And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand
For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie
Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth
For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book
Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people
He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly
Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever
Even so, come, Lord Jesus
And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people
(which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written
by whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name
And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables
among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ
And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it
For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers
And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them
making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you
For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him
For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established
And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)
that is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me
And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men
I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise
For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day
So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also
And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book
because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them
And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made
because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened
And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools
and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite
And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things
unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient
And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments
without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful
And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb
But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things
And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation
And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God
And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp
But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God
And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle
Who will render to every man according to his deeds
And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses
to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life
And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door
but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath
And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend
tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile
And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle
but glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile
And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me
for there is no respect of persons with God
Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight
(for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified
Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people
For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves
And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest
Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God
And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence
and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law
For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight
and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness
is it not in that thou goest with us
Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision
so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth
What advantage then hath the Jew
And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name
or what profit is there of circumcision
And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory
Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God
And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy
God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world
And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live
There is none that understandeth,
And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock
There is none that seeketh after God
and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by
Their throat is an open sepulchre;
and I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen
With their tongues they have used deceit;
And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest
The poison of asps is under their lips
And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness
And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD
Their feet are swift to shed blood
And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth
Destruction and misery are in their ways
keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation
And the way of peace have they not known
And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin
Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite
for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God
Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law
but ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves
What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found
and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods
Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt
Thou shalt make thee no molten gods
and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised
Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest
For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect
And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end
he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God
Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel
and being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning
Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him
The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God
Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience
And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel
and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him
For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly
And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die
And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai
And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement
And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face
(for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law
But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out
For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ
And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded
Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life
And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him
that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord
And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them
What shall we say then
Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day
Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound
and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair
Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death
and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood
For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection
and oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense
knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin
and onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate
For he that is dead is freed from sin
And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded
Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him
the tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets
knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him
the ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering
For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God
the table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread
Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord
the candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light
Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God
and the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle
For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace
the altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot
What then
the hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court
shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace
the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords
But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you
the cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office
Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness
And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses
For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness
And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments
What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed
And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered an offering of gold unto the LORD
for the end of those things is death
And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them
Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth
Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it
For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband
And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen
But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence
And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair
For without the law sin was dead
And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate
For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died
and spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense
And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death
And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah
Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good
and he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship
Was then that which is good made death unto me
and to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass
God forbid
and in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work
But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful
And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan
For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin
Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work
For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I
Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded
If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good
And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it
Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me
and they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal
For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do
And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning
Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me
And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made
I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me
And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make
For I delight in the law of God after the inward man
For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much
but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members
And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them
O wretched man that I am
The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size
who shall deliver me from the body of this death
And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit
Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death
And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit
And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be
And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves
So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God
And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second
Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh
And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God
And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that
The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God
And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us
One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle
For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God
And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward
because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God
and forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now
And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards
But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it
and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose
And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards
Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us
And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord
And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners
Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect
And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets
For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel
And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle
That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed
and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward
Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault
And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other
As he saith also in Osee,
And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold
I will call them my people, which were not my people;
And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work
And her beloved, which was not beloved
And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver
Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved
And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework
What shall we say then
and the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass
That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith
and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about
For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge
And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold
For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them
And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark
But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven
And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat
(that is, to bring Christ down from above:)
one cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof
that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved
And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims
How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed
and he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about
and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard
Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about
and how shall they hear without a preacher
And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof
But they have not all obeyed the gospel
Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table
So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God
And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table
I say then, Hath God cast away his people
And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure gold
God forbid
And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same
For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin
and six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof
But what saith the answer of God unto him
three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick
Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace
And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers
And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace
and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it
But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work
Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold
What then
And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold
Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded
Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof
And David saith,
And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about
Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal
And a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them
And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold
I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall
And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary
God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy
And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass
if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them
And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it
boast not against the branches
And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves
But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee
And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass
And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again
And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance
And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits
even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy
their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver
For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all
And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God
And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver
how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out
And for the east side eastward fifty cubits
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service
The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three
For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office
And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three
so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another
All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen
not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord
And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver
distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality
And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver
Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not
And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass
Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep
This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest
If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men
And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good
All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation
And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary
Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake
And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket
For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing
And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour
And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar
For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about
Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying
And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen
Who art thou that judgest another man's servant
And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work
to his own master he standeth or falleth
They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together
Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand
And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel
For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living
And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses
But why dost thou judge thy brother
And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen
or why dost thou set at nought thy brother
It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled
for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ
And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row
So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God
And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst
Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way
And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes
Let not then your good be evil spoken of
And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold
For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men
And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate
Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another
And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate
For meat destroy not the work of God
And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it
All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence
And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward
It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak
And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin
And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses
We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves
And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue
Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification
And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend
For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope
And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen
Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus
And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates
that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses
Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God
And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons
Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers
and a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen
And again, Esaias saith,
and a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses
There shall be a root of Jesse,
And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses
And he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles;
And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets
And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another
and the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering
I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God
the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat
For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you
the table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread
But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you
the pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light
But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints
and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door
For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem
the brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot
When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain
the cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office
And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ
According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work
Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me
And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them
that I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Now the God of peace be with you all
On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation
Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us
And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail
Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord
And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof
Salute Apelles approved in Christ
And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle
Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household
And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation
Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord
And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate
Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord
And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy
Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them
And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy
Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them
And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it
Salute one another with an holy kiss
And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water
The churches of Christ salute you
And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office
For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple
And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats
I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord
Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he
Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you
And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up
Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother
And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars
The song of songs, which is Solomon's
And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth:
and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses
For thy love is better than wine
And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail
He brought me to the banqueting house,
And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses
And his banner over me was love
And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward
His left hand is under my head,
And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses
And his right hand doth embrace me
And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail
My beloved is mine, and I am his:
and he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses
He feedeth among the lilies
And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle
By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth:
And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses
I sought him, but I found him not
And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal
Thou art all fair, my love;
And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat
There is no spot in thee
when they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses
How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse
And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate
How much better is thy love than wine
So Moses finished the work
And the smell of thine ointments than all spices
Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle
What is thy beloved more than another beloved,
And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle
O thou fairest among women
And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys
What is thy beloved more than another beloved,
but if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up
That thou dost so charge us
For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys
My beloved is white and ruddy,
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying
The chiefest among ten thousand
Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah
His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers:
Who is there among you of all his people
His lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh
his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem
His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl:
And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem
His belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires
Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem
His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold:
And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered
His countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars
Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods
Or ever I was aware,
even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah
My soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib
All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred
This thy stature is like to a palm tree,
All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem
And thy breasts to clusters of grapes
Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city
O that thou wert as my brother,
which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah
That sucked the breasts of my mother
The number of the men of the people of Israel
When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;
the children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and two
Yea, I should not be despised
The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two
His left hand should be under my head,
The children of Pahath-moab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred and twelve
And his right hand should embrace me
The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:
The children of Zattu, nine hundred forty and five
Thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand,
The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and threescore
And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred
The children of Bani, six hundred forty and two
if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly
The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty and three
This witness is true
The children of Azgad, a thousand two hundred twenty and two
Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith
The children of Adonikam, six hundred sixty and six
But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine
The children of Bigvai, two thousand fifty and six
Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded
The children of Adin, four hundred fifty and four
For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men
The children of Ater of Hezekiah, ninety and eight
Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work
The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and three
to speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men
The children of Jorah, an hundred and twelve
But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared
The children of Hashum, two hundred twenty and three
This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works
The children of Gibbar, ninety and five
These things are good and profitable unto men
The children of Beth-lehem, an hundred twenty and three
The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers
The men of Netophah, fifty and six
Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts
The men of Anathoth, an hundred twenty and eight
Your fathers, where are they
The children of Azmaveth, forty and two
and the prophets, do they live for ever
The children of Kirjath-arim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty and three
Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying
The children of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred twenty and one
I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white
The men of Michmas, an hundred twenty and two
And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words
The men of Beth-el and Ai, two hundred twenty and three
So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy
The children of Nebo, fifty and two
Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns
The children of Magbish, an hundred fifty and six
And the LORD shewed me four carpenters
The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four
I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand
The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty
And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him
The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and five
For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye
The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five
For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me
The children of Senaah, three thousand and six hundred and thirty
Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD
The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two
And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee
The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven
And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again
The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen
And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him
the children of Keros, the children of Siaha, the children of Padon
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel
the children of Lebanah, the children of Hagabah, the children of Akkub
And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying
the children of Hagab, the children of Shalmai, the children of Hanan
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by
the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, the children of Reaiah
Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH
the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, the children of Gazzam
And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep
the children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of Besai
and said unto me, What seest thou
the children of Asnah, the children of Mehunim, the children of Nephusim
And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof
the children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
the children of Bazluth, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha
Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll
the children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Thamah
And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah
the children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha
And he said, This is wickedness
the children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel
And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof
the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami
And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth
All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two
And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth
the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two
So they walked to and fro through the earth
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore
Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah
beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women
then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest
Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five
and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD
their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty
And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you
And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place
And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God
they gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments
And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu
So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities
when they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the LORD
And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem
Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying
Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God
Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me
And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening
And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying
They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother
and afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD
But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear
They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia
Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts
Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD
Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts
Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites
but I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not
And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel
Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying
And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age
And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off
saith the LORD of hosts
Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country
then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built
But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us
For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things
Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building
so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not
and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia
These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates
And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem
And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying
Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities
then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites
Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter
Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations
And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock
Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings
And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock
Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king
Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me
that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed
And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people
We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river
And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD
The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me
And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear
And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein
So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver
There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them
And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them
Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me
And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD
Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings
Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel
Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power
And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd
Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them
Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem
At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall
In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness
Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building
And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God
But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter
The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah
The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king
In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them
Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands
And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn
Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls
In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon
We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them
And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart
And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up
the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart
But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon
In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness
But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land
And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive
and said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place
Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee
Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished
For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city
Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon
Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle
And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written
And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south
in the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark
with three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house
but it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light
and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God
And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be
Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence
And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one
let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place
And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited
Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered
And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth
And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail
And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour
that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons
And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance
Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this
And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague
Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily
And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles
And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo
And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles
And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia
This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles
And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king
Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts
And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy
I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the LORD
and offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel
and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham
And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses
and them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him
And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month
And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel
For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves
Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off
And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat
a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers
and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel
And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks
Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah
This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts
the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub
Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city
the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth
Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow
the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki
Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law
the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest
For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent
And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king
From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering
And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king
I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD
For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him
In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack
For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments
I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden
Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel
Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time
I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee
Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand
and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem
that thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem
And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God
The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem
And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house
And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily
unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much
Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons
Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them
And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not
And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment
Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem
and hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes
And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me
These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king
Of the sons of Pahath-moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males
Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males
Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males
And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males
And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males
Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males
And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and threescore males
And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males
And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males
And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males
Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males
And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi
Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding
And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God
And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen
and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty
also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name
Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance
For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him
So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us
Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them
and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered
I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents
also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold
Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD
So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God
And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days
Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites
by number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time
Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD
And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God
Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites
For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass
And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied
Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice
And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God
Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day
And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage
For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem
which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness
Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever
should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations
wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping
Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore
And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing
Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law
Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it
Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away
And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem
and that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away
And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel
Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives
Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do
Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us
Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them
And the children of the captivity did so
And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter
And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month
And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass
And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah
And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah
And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah
Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer
Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah
and Bani, and Binnui, Shimei
Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light
And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night
And the evening and the morning were the first day
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so
And God called the firmament Heaven
And the evening and the morning were the second day
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so
And the evening and the morning were the third day
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so
And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth
And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day
And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so
And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat
And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so
And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good
And the evening and the morning were the sixth day
Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made
And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made
and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground
But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground
And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul
And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads
The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold
and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone
And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia
And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria
And the fourth river is Euphrates
And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it
And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat
And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof
And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof
and the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed
And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die
And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons
And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living
Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them
therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken
So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life
And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD
And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth
and why is thy countenance fallen
If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted
and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door
And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him
And he said, What hast thou done
the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground
And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand
And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear
And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold
And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him
And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden
And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch
And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech
And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah
And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle
And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ
This is the book of the generations of Adam
In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him
male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created
And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth
and the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters
and all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died
And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos
and Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died
And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan
and Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died
And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel
and Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died
And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared
and Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died
And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch
and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died
And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah
and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years
and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him
And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech
and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died
And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son
And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died
And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth
And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose
There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown
And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart
But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD
And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth
The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence
And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth
Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch
And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits
A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it
But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee
And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female
Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive
Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he
And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation
Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female
Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth
And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him
And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth
And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood
Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth
there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah
And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth
In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened
And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights
In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark
they, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort
And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life
And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in
And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth
And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters
And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered
Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered
And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died
And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark
And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days
And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained
And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen
And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made
and he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth
Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground
And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark
and the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth
And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more
And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry
And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried
And God spake unto Noah, saying
Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee
And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him
every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark
And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth
And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered
But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat
And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man
Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man
And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying
And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you
and with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth
And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations
I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth
And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud
and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh
These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread
And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard
and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent
And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without
And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness
And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him
And he said,
Blessed be the LORD God of Shem;
And Canaan shall be his servant
And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years
And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died
The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras
And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim
And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan
And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan
And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar
Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah
and Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city
And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim
And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth
and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite
and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite
And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha
These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations
The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram
And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash
And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber
And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan
And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah
And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east
These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations
These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood
And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech
And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there
And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded
So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city
and Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters
And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah
and Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters
And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber
and Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters
And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg
and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters
And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu
and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters
And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug
and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters
And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor
and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters
And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah
and Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters
And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran
Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot
And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees
And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah
But Sarai was barren; she had no child
And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there
And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran
Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee
And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came
And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh
And the Canaanite was then in the land
And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south
And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon
therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive
And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair
The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house
And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels
And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife
And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me
why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife
And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had
And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south
And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold
And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Hai
And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents
And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together
And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren
Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom
But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly
And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward
for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever
And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered
Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD
And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations
that these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar
All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea
Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled
And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim
and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness
And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar
And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim
with Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five
And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain
And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way
And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed
And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram
And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan
And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus
And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people
And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale
And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God
And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth
And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness
And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not
And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away
And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years
and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age
And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces
In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates
the Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites
Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar
And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife
But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee
And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face
And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur
And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou
and whither wilt thou go
Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered
And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael
And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect
And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying
As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations
Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee
And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee
And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee
And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations
This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised
And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you
And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed
And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him
And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham
And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him
And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son
And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him
And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day
and said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant
let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree
And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it
Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women
And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do
seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him
And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous
And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD
And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked
And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes
And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place
But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter
And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him
and said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly
But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door
And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door
And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides
son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place
And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city
But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law
And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord
And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken
The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar
Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven
and he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground
But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt
And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD
and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace
And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt
And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters
And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth
And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose
Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father
And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day
And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day
But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation
And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her
Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid
And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake
And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife
And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife
So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children
For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife
And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken
For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him
And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac
And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him
And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him
And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned
And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking
And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son
And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs
And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child
And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept
And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer
And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt
And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest
And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away
And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant
And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves
Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them
And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God
And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days
Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off
And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together
And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood
And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son
And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son
And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time
and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son
that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies
So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba
And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor
Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram
And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah
And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying
And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him
And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth
And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar
And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying
And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land
And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him
And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city
And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan
And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth
And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things
And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh
and I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell
And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter
And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor
And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water
Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water
And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink
And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels
And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not
And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold
And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD
And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things
And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well
And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him
And he said, I am Abraham's servant
And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses
And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath
And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell
And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house
and she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son
And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son
Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good
And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth
And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things
And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men
And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way
And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country
And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming
And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel
For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us
And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself
And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done
Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah
And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah
And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac
But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country
And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years
Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people
And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre
And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi
Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham
Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah
And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people
And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren
And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus
And she went to enquire of the LORD
And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb
And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents
And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob
And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob
And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham
And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar
And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of
and I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed
And Isaac dwelt in Gerar
And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon
And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife
Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him
And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great
for he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him
For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth
And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there
And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them
And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water
And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land
And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba
Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army
And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you
And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee
And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink
And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water
And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day
And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite
which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah
And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death
now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison
and make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die
And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son
And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it
And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying
Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death
Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth
and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death
And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man
my father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing
And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved
And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob
And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son
And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me
And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau
And he said, Art thou my very son Esau
And he said, I am
And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee
And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank
Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven,
And the fatness of the earth,
And plenty of corn and wine
And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting
And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me
And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou
And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau
And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who
where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him
yea, and he shall be blessed
And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing
And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob
for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing
And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me
And Isaac his father answered and said unto him,
Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth,
And of the dew of heaven from above
And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob
And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran
and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away
And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan
Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother
And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people
and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham
And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother
When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan
and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram
and Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father
And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran
And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it
and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed
And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of
And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not
And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place
this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven
And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it
And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on
so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God
and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee
Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east
And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place
And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor
And they said, We know him
And he said unto them, Is he well
And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep
And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them
And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep
And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them
And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother
And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept
And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house
And he told Laban all these things
And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh
And he abode with him the space of a month
And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought
tell me, what shall thy wages be
And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel
Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured
And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter
And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me
And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her
And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her
And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast
And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her
And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid
And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn
And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also
And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid
And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren
And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon
And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die
And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb
And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her
And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her
And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son
And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son
When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife
And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son
And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son
And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah
Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes
And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband
and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also
And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes
And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes
And he lay with her that night
And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son
And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son
And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah
And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb
And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach
And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country
Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee
And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it
And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me
I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire
And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word
And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons
And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks
And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods
And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink
And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted
And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle
And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods
But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's
And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses
And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory
And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before
And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee
And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock
and said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me
And ye know that with all my power I have served your father
If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked
Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me
And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled
And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee
And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house
Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels
and he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan
And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's
And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled
So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead
And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled
And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead
And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad
It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad
And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods
And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me
And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not
Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent
Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them
And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not
This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten
Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes
Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times
Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty
God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight
And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born
And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar
And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap
And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed
And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day
Therefore was the name of it called Galeed
and Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another
And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee
this heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm
The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us
And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac
And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place
And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him
And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom
And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now
and I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight
And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him
Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands
and said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape
Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children
And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother
two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams
thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals
And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove
And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou
and whither goest thou
and whose are these before thee
And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him
So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company
And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok
And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had
And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day
And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him
And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh
And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me
And he said unto him, What is thy name
And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved
And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh
Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank
And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men
And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids
And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost
And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother
And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept
Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves
And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves
And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me
Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough
And he urged him, and he took it
And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die
Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir
So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir
And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money
And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel
And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land
And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her
And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel
And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife
And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him
And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done
And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife
And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you
And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give
Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife
And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister
and they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us
but in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised
then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people
But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone
And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son
And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying
Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised
Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's
only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us
And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city
And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males
And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister
They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field
and all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house
And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot
Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments
and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went
And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem
And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob
So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Beth-el, he and all the people that were with him
And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother
And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins
and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land
And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him
And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon
And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour
And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also
And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day
And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar
And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned
And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years
Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom
Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite
and Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth
And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel
And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob
For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle
Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom
And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir
these are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau
And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz
And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife
These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz
duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah
These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes
These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah
And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna
And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam
And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah
And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran
The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan
The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran
These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah
And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah
And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead
And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead
And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead
And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead
And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead
And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth
duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon
duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar
And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan
And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him
for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf
And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me
And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed
Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth
And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem
And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou
And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks
And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan
And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan
And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him
Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams
And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him
And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood
And his brethren were content
Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt
And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes
And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood
And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days
And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning
Thus his father wept for him
And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard
And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah
And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her
And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan
And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar
And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him
And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother
And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also
And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep
And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife
When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face
And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law
) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me
And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock
And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it
And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood
And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not
Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side
And they said, There was no harlot in this place
And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place
And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her
And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom
And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt
And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son
And he knew her again no more
And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb
And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first
And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither
And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian
And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand
And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand
And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field
And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat
And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured
And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me
But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand
And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her
And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within
And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth
And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home
And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me
and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out
And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled
But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison
And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it
The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper
And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt
And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers
And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound
And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward
And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison
And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad
And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day
And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me
and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand
And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler
But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house
for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head
And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee
And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants
And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand
but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them
Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him
And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow
And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river
And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good
And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them
And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears
And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream
And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh
Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day
Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker
and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream
And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret
And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged
Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it
And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river
and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow
and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness
and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine
And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good
and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them
And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do
The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one
And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine
This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh
Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt
and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous
And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass
Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt
Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years
And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities
And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine
And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants
And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art
And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt
And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On
And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt
And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt
And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt
And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls
And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same
And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number
And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house
And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction
And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended
And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt
And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands
Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another
And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die
And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt
But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him
And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan
And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye
And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food
And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him
And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come
And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come
We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies
And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come
And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not
And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies
hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither
And he put them all together into ward three days
And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God
if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses
And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us
And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear
therefore, behold, also his blood is required
And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter
And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes
And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence
And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth
And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying
The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country
And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies
we be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan
And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone
And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid
And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again
And the famine was sore in the land
And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food
And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you
If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food
but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you
And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother
And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones
for except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time
And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds
take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man
And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph
And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon
And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house
And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses
And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house
And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender
And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there
And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth
And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake
And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread
And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians
And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another
And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth
And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money
And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken
As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses
And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good
Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth
ye have done evil in so doing
And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words
And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words
God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing
behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold
With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen
Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack
And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground
And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done
wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine
And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord
what shall we speak
or how shall we clear ourselves
God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found
Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh
My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother
And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him
And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die
And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more
And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord
And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food
And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us
And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons
and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since
and if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life
For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever
Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren
For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me
lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father
And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard
And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you
And they came near
And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt
Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life
For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest
And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance
So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt
and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast
and there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty
And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you
And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither
And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck
And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan
Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come
Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your's
To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment
And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way
And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father
and told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt
And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not
And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived
and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die
And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac
And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob
And he said, Here am I
And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him
And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him
his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt
These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three
And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him
These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen
All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six
and the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten
And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while
And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me
Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen
And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh
And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation
And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers
They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen
And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee
the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle
And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou
And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage
And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh
And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded
And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families
And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine
And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house
And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail
When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands
And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's
And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof
Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land
And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones
And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years
And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt
And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed
And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me
And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance
And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these
And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place
And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them
And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed
And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth
And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him
And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head
And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head
And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers
Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow
And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days
Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob;
And hearken unto Israel your father
Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel;
Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed;
Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch
Simeon and Levi are brethren;
Instruments of cruelty are in their habitations
O my soul, come not thou into their secret;
Unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united:
For in their anger they slew a man,
And in their selfwill they digged down a wall
Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;
And their wrath, for it was cruel:
I will divide them in Jacob,
And scatter them in Israel
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,
Nor a lawgiver from between his feet,
Until Shiloh come;
And unto him shall the gathering of the people be
His eyes shall be red with wine,
And his teeth white with milk
Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea;
And he shall be for an haven of ships;
And his border shall be unto Zidon
Issachar is a strong ass
Couching down between two burdens
And he saw that rest was good,
And the land that it was pleasant;
And bowed his shoulder to bear,
And became a servant unto tribute
Dan shall judge his people,
As one of the tribes of Israel
Gad, a troop shall overcome him:
But he shall overcome at the last
Out of Asher his bread shall be fat,
And he shall yield royal dainties
Naphtali is a hind let loose:
He giveth goodly words
Joseph is a fruitful bough,
Even a fruitful bough by a well;
Whose branches run over the wall
The archers have sorely grieved him,
And shot at him, and hated him
Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee;
And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee
With blessings of heaven above,
Blessings of the deep that lieth under,
Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb
The blessings of thy father
Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors
Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:
They shall be on the head of Joseph,
And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren
Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf:
In the morning he shall devour the prey,
And at night he shall divide the spoil
All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them
And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite
in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace
There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah
The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth
And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people
And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him
And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel
And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days
And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying
My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me
Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again
And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear
And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt
and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen
And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company
And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them
for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre
And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father
And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him
And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying
So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father
And Joseph wept when they spake unto him
And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants
And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God
But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive
Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones
And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them
And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years
And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees
Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them
And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand
And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot
So Simeon went with him
And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men
And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites
But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes
Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire
And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley
And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai
and Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife
And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife
And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people
Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof
And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron
And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day
And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el: and the LORD was with them
And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy
And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day
Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land
And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out
Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them
Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries
Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob
but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out
Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries unto them
And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley
but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries
And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward
Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you
And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept
And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD
And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land
And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel
And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old
And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash
And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim
And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth
And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies
Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them
And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them
And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way
And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice
I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died
that through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not
Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua
Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan
only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof
namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath
And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses
And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves
And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD
So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years
But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh
And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present
And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone
And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee
And he arose out of his seat
And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly
Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them
When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber
And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth
And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath
And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them
And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand
And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over
And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man
And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel
And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead
And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel
And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time
And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment
And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun
And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand
And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman
And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh
And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him
Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh
And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor
And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon
But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left
Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite
And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not
And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle
And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty
And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him
Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary
So he died
And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest
And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples
So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel
And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan
Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying
Praise ye the LORD
For the avenging of Israel,
When the people willingly offered themselves
LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir,
When thou marchedst out of the field of Edom,
The earth trembled, and the heavens dropped,
The clouds also dropped water
The mountains melted from before the LORD,
Even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel
In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,
In the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied,
And the travellers walked through byways
The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
Until that I Deborah arose,
That I arose a mother in Israel
They chose new gods;
Then was war in the gates:
Was there a shield or spear seen
Among forty thousand in Israel
My heart is toward the governors of Israel,
That offered themselves willingly among the people
Bless ye the LORD
They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water,
There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD,
Even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel:
Then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates
Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek;
After thee, Benjamin, among thy people;
Out of Machir came down governors,
And out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer
And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah;
Even Issachar, and also Barak:
He was sent on foot into the valley
For the divisions of Reuben
There were great thoughts of heart
Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds,
To hear the bleatings of the flocks
For the divisions of Reuben
There were great searchings of heart
Gilead abode beyond Jordan:
And why did Dan remain in ships
Asher continued on the sea shore,
And abode in his breaches
Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death
In the high places of the field
They fought from heaven;
The stars in their courses fought against Sisera
The river of Kishon swept them away,
That ancient river, the river Kishon
O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength
Then were the horsehoofs broken
By the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones
Blessed above women shall Jael
The wife of Heber the Kenite be,
Blessed shall she be above women in the tent
He asked water, and she gave him milk;
She brought forth butter in a lordly dish
She put her hand to the nail,
And her right hand to the workmen's hammer;
And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head,
When she had pierced and stricken through his temples
At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down:
At her feet he bowed, he fell:
Where he bowed, there he fell down dead
The mother of Sisera looked out at a window,
And cried through the lattice,
Why is his chariot so long in coming
Why tarry the wheels of his chariots
Her wise ladies answered her,
Yea, she returned answer to herself
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years
And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds
And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them
and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass
And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land
And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abi-ezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites
And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour
And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel
behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house
And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man
And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me
And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth
And he did so
And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD
for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face
And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die
And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built
And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing
And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing
Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it
Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel
But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abi-ezer was gathered after him
And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said
Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said
And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water
Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley
And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me
Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead
And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand
And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand
But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host
and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host
Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host
And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude
And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers
And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do
When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon
And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites
And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you
Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer
God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you
Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that
And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them
And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian
And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army
And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers
And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower
Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword
And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure
And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host
And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up
And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary
And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth
And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city
Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor
And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king
And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you
And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them
But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth
Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength
And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks
Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian
And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you
And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey
(For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites
And they answered, We will willingly give them
And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey
And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks
Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more
And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon
And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house
And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives
And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech
And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites
And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god
And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side
neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel
And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying
Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you
remember also that I am your bone and your flesh
And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother
And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him
And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem
And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you
But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees
And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us
But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees
Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us
And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees
Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us
And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon
Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands
(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian
and ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)
if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you
but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech
And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother
When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel
then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech
that the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren
And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled
And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee
Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field
And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies
And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait
And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim
Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him
is not this the people that thou hast despised
go out, I pray now, and fight with them
And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech
And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech
And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them
And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt
And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith
And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together
Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it
But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower
And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull
Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him
And his young man thrust him through, and he died
And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place
Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren
And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir
And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years
And Jair died, and was buried in Camon
And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon
Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed
And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim
And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines
Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more
Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation
Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead
And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh
Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him
And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel
And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob
and they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon
And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead
And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head
And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words
And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land
And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably
And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon
and said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon
but when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh
And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place
And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country
And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan
So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it
Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess
So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess
And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab
did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them
Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him
Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon
And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands
So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands
And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter
thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back
And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows
that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year
And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee
we will burn thine house upon thee with fire
And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands
then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right
Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand
And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel
And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons
And he judged Israel seven years
Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Beth-lehem
And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years
And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun
And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel
And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years
And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son
Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing
but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death
Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born
And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her
And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day
And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass
And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware
And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee
And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour
And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret
And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God
But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these
And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol
And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife
Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines
And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well
But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel
And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well
And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion
So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do
And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him
And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments
but if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments
And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it
And he said unto them,
Out of the eater came forth meat,
And out of the strong came forth sweetness
And they could not in three days expound the riddle
But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend
And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure
And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives
Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this
And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion
And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire
And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease
And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam
Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi
Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us
what is this that thou hast done unto us
And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them
And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines
And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves
And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee
And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock
And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands
And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith
And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither
And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him
And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron
And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah
And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver
And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee
Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them
And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound
And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man
And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson
And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web
And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death
And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart
Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand
And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson
And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself
And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him
But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house
Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven
And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them
Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport
And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left
And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah
And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it
And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son
Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah
And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest
And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou
And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place
And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals
So the Levite went in
And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah
Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest
In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel
When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither
and what makest thou in this place
and what hast thou here
And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest
And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous
And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go
And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war
And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah
And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him
And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate
And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war
And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel
And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people
So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them
And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan
And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more
and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee
And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household
And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house
And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire
And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob
And they built a city, and dwelt therein
And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first
And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land
And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there
And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry
And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again
And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee
And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them
And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it
And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah
And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin
And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging
And he said unto him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Beth-lehem-judah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house
So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink
Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him
And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly
Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing
But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go
Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light
And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold
And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel
(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh
) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness
And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge
And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead
And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel
Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel
And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house
But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it
and we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel
So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man
And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you
Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel
But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel
but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel
And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men
And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war
And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin
And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first
And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah
And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah
And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men
And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day
(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother
And the LORD said, Go up against him
And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day
And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword
Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD
And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah
And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times
And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah
And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword
So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah
And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword
Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city
But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven
And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them
Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them
Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising
And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour
So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour
But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months
And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to
Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife
And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore
and said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD
For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death
And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day
How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives
For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there
And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children
And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man
And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan
And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them
And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not
And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel
Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin
And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel
Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin
Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah
Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards
and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin
And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty
And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them
And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance
In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes
There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil
And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters
His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east
And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them
Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them
Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side
thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land
And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house
and there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them
Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped
In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly
Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD
So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown
And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes
But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh
In all this did not Job sin with his lips
So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great
After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day
Let that day be darkness;
Let not God regard it from above,
Neither let the light shine upon it
Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it;
Let a cloud dwell upon it;
Let the blackness of the day terrify it
As for that night, let darkness seize upon it;
Let it not be joined unto the days of the year,
Let it not come into the number of the months
Lo, let that night be solitary,
Let no joyful voice come therein
Let them curse it that curse the day,
Who are ready to raise up their mourning
Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb,
Nor hid sorrow from mine eyes
For now should I have lain still and been quiet,
I should have slept: then had I been at rest
With kings and counsellors of the earth,
Which built desolate places for themselves
Or with princes that had gold,
Who filled their houses with silver
Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been;
As infants which never saw light
There the wicked cease from troubling;
And there the weary be at rest
There the prisoners rest together;
They hear not the voice of the oppressor
Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,
And life unto the bitter in soul
Which long for death, but it cometh not;
And dig for it more than for hid treasures
Which rejoice exceedingly,
And are glad, when they can find the grave
For my sighing cometh before I eat,
And my roarings are poured out like the waters
For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me,
And that which I was afraid of is come unto me
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said
If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved
But who can withhold himself from speaking
Behold, thou hast instructed many,
And thou hast strengthened the weak hands
Thy words have upholden him that was falling,
And thou hast strengthened the feeble knees
But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest;
It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled
Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent
Or where were the righteous cut off
Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,
And sow wickedness, reap the same
By the blast of God they perish,
And by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed
The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,
And the teeth of the young lions, are broken
Now a thing was secretly brought to me,
And mine ear received a little thereof
In thoughts from the visions of the night,
When deep sleep falleth on men
Fear came upon me, and trembling,
Which made all my bones to shake
Then a spirit passed before my face;
The hair of my flesh stood up
It stood still,
But I could not discern the form thereof:
An image was before mine eyes,
There was silence, and I heard a voice, saying
Shall mortal man be more just than God
Shall a man be more pure than his maker
Behold, he put no trust in his servants;
And his angels he charged with folly
How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay,
Whose foundation is in the dust,
Which are crushed before the moth
They are destroyed from morning to evening:
They perish for ever without any regarding it
Call now, if there be any that will answer thee;
And to which of the saints wilt thou turn
For wrath killeth the foolish man,
And envy slayeth the silly one
Whose harvest the hungry eateth up,
And taketh it even out of the thorns,
And the robber swalloweth up their substance
Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust,
Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground
I would seek unto God,
And unto God would I commit my cause
Which doeth great things and unsearchable;
Marvellous things without number
Who giveth rain upon the earth,
And sendeth waters upon the fields
To set up on high those that be low;
That those which mourn may be exalted to safety
He disappointeth the devices of the crafty,
So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise
He taketh the wise in their own craftiness:
And the counsel of the froward is carried headlong
They meet with darkness in the daytime,
And grope in the noonday as in the night
But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth,
And from the hand of the mighty
Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth:
Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty
For he maketh sore, and bindeth up:
He woundeth, and his hands make whole
He shall deliver thee in six troubles:
Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee
In famine he shall redeem thee from death:
And in war from the power of the sword
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue:
Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh
At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh:
Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth
For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field:
And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee
And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace;
And thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin
Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,
And thine offspring as the grass of the earth
But Job answered and said
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
Therefore my words are swallowed up
For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,
The poison whereof drinketh up my spirit:
The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me
Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass
Or loweth the ox over his fodder
Oh that I might have my request;
And that God would grant me the thing that I long for
Even that it would please God to destroy me;
That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off
What is my strength, that I should hope
And what is mine end, that I should prolong my life
Is my strength the strength of stones
Or is my flesh of brass
Is not my help in me
And is wisdom driven quite from me
To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend;
But he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty
Which are blackish by reason of the ice,
And wherein the snow is hid
What time they wax warm, they vanish:
When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place
The paths of their way are turned aside;
They go to nothing, and perish
The troops of Tema looked,
The companies of Sheba waited for them
They were confounded because they had hoped;
They came thither, and were ashamed
For now ye are nothing;
Ye see my casting down, and are afraid
Did I say, Bring unto me
Or, Give a reward for me of your substance
Teach me, and I will hold my tongue:
And cause me to understand wherein I have erred
How forcible are right words
But what doth your arguing reprove
Do ye imagine to reprove words,
And the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind
Now therefore be content, look upon me;
For it is evident unto you if I lie
Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity;
Yea, return again, my righteousness is in it
Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth
Are not his days also like the days of an hireling
As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow,
And as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work
So am I made to possess months of vanity,
And wearisome nights are appointed to me
My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,
And are spent without hope
O remember that my life is wind:
Mine eye shall no more see good
The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more:
Thine eyes are upon me, and I am not
As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away:
So he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more
Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;
I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
I will complain in the bitterness of my soul
When I say, My bed shall comfort me,
My couch shall ease my complaint
Then thou scarest me with dreams,
And terrifiest me through visions
So that my soul chooseth strangling,
And death rather than my life
What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him
And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him
And that thou shouldest visit him every morning,
And try him every moment
How long wilt thou not depart from me,
Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle
And why dost thou not pardon my transgression,
And take away mine iniquity
For now shall I sleep in the dust;
And thou shalt seek me in the morning,
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said
How long wilt thou speak these things
And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind
Doth God pervert judgment
Or doth the Almighty pervert justice
If thy children have sinned against him,
And he have cast them away for their transgression
If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes,
And make thy supplication to the Almighty
Though thy beginning was small,
Yet thy latter end should greatly increase
For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age,
And prepare thyself to the search of their fathers
(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,
Because our days upon earth are a shadow:)
Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee,
And utter words out of their heart
Can the rush grow up without mire
Can the flag grow without water
Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down,
It withereth before any other herb
So are the paths of all that forget God;
And the hypocrite's hope shall perish
Whose hope shall be cut off,
And whose trust shall be a spider's web
He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand:
He shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure
He is green before the sun,
And his branch shooteth forth in his garden
Behold, this is the joy of his way,
And out of the earth shall others grow
Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man,
Neither will he help the evil doers
Till he fill thy mouth with laughing,
And thy lips with rejoicing
Then Job answered and said
I know it is so of a truth:
But how should man be just with God
If he will contend with him,
He cannot answer him one of a thousand
He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:
Who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered
Which removeth the mountains, and they know not:
Which overturneth them in his anger
Which shaketh the earth out of her place,
And the pillars thereof tremble
And sealeth up the stars
Which alone spreadeth out the heavens,
And treadeth upon the waves of the sea
Which doeth great things past finding out;
Yea, and wonders without number
Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not:
He passeth on also, but I perceive him not
If God will not withdraw his anger,
The proud helpers do stoop under him
How much less shall I answer him,
And choose out my words to reason with him
Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer,
But I would make supplication to my judge
If I had called, and he had answered me;
Yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice
For he breaketh me with a tempest,
And multiplieth my wounds without cause
He will not suffer me to take my breath,
But filleth me with bitterness
If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong:
And if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead
Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul:
I would despise my life
This is one thing, therefore I said it,
He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked
If the scourge slay suddenly,
He will laugh at the trial of the innocent
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked:
He covereth the faces of the judges thereof;
If not, where, and who is he
Now my days are swifter than a post:
They flee away, they see no good
They are passed away as the swift ships:
As the eagle that hasteth to the prey
I am afraid of all my sorrows,
I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent
If I be wicked,
Why then labour I in vain
If I wash myself with snow water,
And make my hands never so clean
Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch,
And mine own clothes shall abhor me
Neither is there any daysman betwixt us,
That might lay his hand upon us both
Then would I speak, and not fear him;
But it is not so with me
My soul is weary of my life;
I will leave my complaint upon myself;
I will speak in the bitterness of my soul
I will say unto God, Do not condemn me;
Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me
Hast thou eyes of flesh
Or seest thou as man seeth
Are thy days as the days of man
Are thy years as man's days
That thou enquirest after mine iniquity,
And searchest after my sin
Thou knowest that I am not wicked;
And there is none that can deliver out of thine hand
Thine hands have made me and fashioned me
Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me
Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay;
And wilt thou bring me into dust again
Hast thou not poured me out as milk,
And curdled me like cheese
Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,
And hast fenced me with bones and sinews
And these things hast thou hid in thine heart:
I know that this is with thee
If I sin, then thou markest me,
And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity
Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb
Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me
I should have been as though I had not been;
I should have been carried from the womb to the grave
Before I go whence I shall not return,
Even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said
Should thy lies make men hold their peace
And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed
Canst thou by searching find out God
Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection
The measure thereof is longer than the earth,
And broader than the sea
If he cut off, and shut up,
Or gather together, then who can hinder him
For vain man would be wise,
Though man be born like a wild ass's colt
If thou prepare thine heart,
And stretch out thine hands toward him
If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away,
And let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles
For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot;
Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear
Because thou shalt forget thy misery,
And remember it as waters that pass away
And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday;
Thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning
Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;
Yea, many shall make suit unto thee
But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,
And they shall not escape,
And their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost
And Job answered and said
No doubt but ye are the people,
And wisdom shall die with you
He that is ready to slip with his feet
Is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease
But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;
And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee
Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee:
And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee
Who knoweth not in all these
That the hand of the LORD hath wrought this
In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,
And the breath of all mankind
Doth not the ear try words
And the mouth taste his meat
With the ancient is wisdom;
And in length of days understanding
With him is wisdom and strength,
He hath counsel and understanding
Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again:
He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening
Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up:
Also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth
He leadeth counsellors away spoiled,
And maketh the judges fools
He looseth the bond of kings,
And girdeth their loins with a girdle
He leadeth princes away spoiled,
And overthroweth the mighty
He removeth away the speech of the trusty,
And taketh away the understanding of the aged
He poureth contempt upon princes,
And weakeneth the strength of the mighty
He discovereth deep things out of darkness,
And bringeth out to light the shadow of death
He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth,
And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way
They grope in the dark without light,
And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man
Lo, mine eye hath seen all this,
Mine ear hath heard and understood it
What ye know, the same do I know also:
I am not inferior unto you
Surely I would speak to the Almighty,
And I desire to reason with God
But ye are forgers of lies,
Ye are all physicians of no value
O that ye would altogether hold your peace
And it should be your wisdom
Hear now my reasoning,
And hearken to the pleadings of my lips
Will ye accept his person
Will ye contend for God
Is it good that he should search you out
Or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him
He will surely reprove you,
If ye do secretly accept persons
Shall not his excellency make you afraid
And his dread fall upon you
Your remembrances are like unto ashes,
Your bodies to bodies of clay
Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak,
And let come on me what will
Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth,
And put my life in mine hand
Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him:
But I will maintain mine own ways before him
He also shall be my salvation:
For an hypocrite shall not come before him
Hear diligently my speech,
And my declaration with your ears
Behold now, I have ordered my cause;
I know that I shall be justified
Who is he that will plead with me
For now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost
Withdraw thine hand far from me:
And let not thy dread make me afraid
Then call thou, and I will answer:
Or let me speak, and answer thou me
How many are mine iniquities and sins
Make me to know my transgression and my sin
Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
And holdest me for thine enemy
Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro
And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble
For thou writest bitter things against me,
And makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth
And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth,
As a garment that is moth eaten
Man that is born of a woman
Is of few days, and full of trouble
He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down:
He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not
And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one,
And bringest me into judgment with thee
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean
Not one
Turn from him, that he may rest,
Till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day
Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,
And the stock thereof die in the ground
Yet through the scent of water it will bud,
And bring forth boughs like a plant
But man dieth, and wasteth away:
Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he
As the waters fail from the sea,
And the flood decayeth and drieth up
So man lieth down, and riseth not:
Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake,
Nor be raised out of their sleep
O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave,
That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past,
That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me
If a man die, shall he live again
All the days of my appointed time will I wait,
Till my change come
Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee:
Thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands
For now thou numberest my steps:
Dost thou not watch over my sin
My transgression is sealed up in a bag,
And thou sewest up mine iniquity
And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought,
And the rock is removed out of his place
The waters wear the stones:
Thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth;
And thou destroyest the hope of man
Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth:
Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away
His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not;
And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them
But his flesh upon him shall have pain,
And his soul within him shall mourn
Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said
Should a wise man utter vain knowledge,
And fill his belly with the east wind
Should he reason with unprofitable talk
Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good
Yea, thou castest off fear,
And restrainest prayer before God
For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity,
And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty
Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I:
Yea, thine own lips testify against thee
Art thou the first man that was born
Or wast thou made before the hills
Hast thou heard the secret of God
And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself
What knowest thou, that we know not
What understandest thou, which is not in us
With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men,
Much elder than thy father
Are the consolations of God small with thee
Is there any secret thing with thee
That thou turnest thy spirit against God,
And lettest such words go out of thy mouth
What is man, that he should be clean
And he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous
Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints;
Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight
How much more abominable and filthy is man,
Which drinketh iniquity like water
I will shew thee, hear me;
And that which I have seen I will declare
Which wise men have told
From their fathers, and have not hid it
Unto whom alone the earth was given,
And no stranger passed among them
The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days,
And the number of years is hidden to the oppressor
A dreadful sound is in his ears:
In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him
He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness,
And he is waited for of the sword
He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it
He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand
Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid;
They shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle
For he stretcheth out his hand against God,
And strengtheneth himself against the Almighty
He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
Neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth
Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity:
For vanity shall be his recompence
He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,
And shall cast off his flower as the olive
For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate,
And fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery
They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity,
And their belly prepareth deceit
Then Job answered and said
I have heard many such things:
Miserable comforters are ye all
Shall vain words have an end
Or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest
I also could speak as ye do:
If your soul were in my soul's stead,
I could heap up words against you,
And shake mine head at you
But I would strengthen you with my mouth,
And the moving of my lips should asswage your grief
Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged:
And though I forbear, what am I eased
But now he hath made me weary:
Thou hast made desolate all my company
And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me:
And my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face
He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me:
He gnasheth upon me with his teeth;
Mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me
God hath delivered me to the ungodly,
And turned me over into the hands of the wicked
I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder:
He hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces,
And set me up for his mark
His archers compass me round about,
He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;
He poureth out my gall upon the ground
He breaketh me with breach upon breach,
He runneth upon me like a giant
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
And defiled my horn in the dust
My face is foul with weeping,
And on my eyelids is the shadow of death
Not for any injustice in mine hands:
Also my prayer is pure
O earth, cover not thou my blood,
And let my cry have no place
Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven,
And my record is on high
My friends scorn me:
but mine eye poureth out tears unto God
O that one might plead for a man with God,
As a man pleadeth for his neighbour
When a few years are come,
Then I shall go the way whence I shall not return
Are there not mockers with me
And doth not mine eye continue in their provocation
For thou hast hid their heart from understanding:
Therefore shalt thou not exalt them
He that speaketh flattery to his friends,
Even the eyes of his children shall fail
He hath made me also a byword of the people;
And aforetime I was as a tabret
Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow,
And all my members are as a shadow
Upright men shall be astonied at this,
And the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite
The righteous also shall hold on his way,
And he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger
But as for you all, do ye return, and come now:
For I cannot find one wise man among you
They change the night into day:
The light is short because of darkness
If I wait, the grave is mine house:
I have made my bed in the darkness
I have said to corruption, Thou art my father:
To the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister
And where is now my hope
As for my hope, who shall see it
They shall go down to the bars of the pit,
When our rest together is in the dust
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said
How long will it be ere ye make an end of words
Mark, and afterwards we will speak
Wherefore are we counted as beasts,
And reputed vile in your sight
He teareth himself in his anger:
Shall the earth be forsaken for thee
And shall the rock be removed out of his place
Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out,
And the spark of his fire shall not shine
The light shall be dark in his tabernacle,
And his candle shall be put out with him
The steps of his strength shall be straitened,
And his own counsel shall cast him down
For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
And he walketh upon a snare
The snare is laid for him in the ground,
And a trap for him in the way
Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,
And shall drive him to his feet
It shall devour the strength of his skin:
Even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength
His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle,
And it shall bring him to the king of terrors
It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:
Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation
His roots shall be dried up beneath,
And above shall his branch be cut off
His remembrance shall perish from the earth,
And he shall have no name in the street
He shall be driven from light into darkness,
And chased out of the world
He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people,
Nor any remaining in his dwellings
They that come after him shall be astonied at his day,
As they that went before were affrighted
Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked,
And this is the place of him that knoweth not God
Then Job answered and said
How long will ye vex my soul,
And break me in pieces with words
These ten times have ye reproached me:
Ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me
And be it indeed that I have erred,
Mine error remaineth with myself
If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me,
And plead against me my reproach
Know now that God hath overthrown me,
And hath compassed me with his net
He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass,
And he hath set darkness in my paths
He hath stripped me of my glory,
And taken the crown from my head
He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone:
And mine hope hath he removed like a tree
He hath also kindled his wrath against me,
And he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies
He hath put my brethren far from me,
And mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me
I called my servant, and he gave me no answer;
I intreated him with my mouth
My breath is strange to my wife,
Though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body
All my inward friends abhorred me:
And they whom I loved are turned against me
My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,
And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth
Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;
For the hand of God hath touched me
Why do ye persecute me as God,
And are not satisfied with my flesh
Oh that my words were now written
Oh that they were printed in a book
That they were graven with an iron pen and lead
In the rock for ever
For I know that my redeemer liveth,
And that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth
And though after my skin worms destroy this body,
Yet in my flesh shall I see God
Whom I shall see for myself,
And mine eyes shall behold, and not another;
Though my reins be consumed within me
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said
Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer,
And for this I make haste
I have heard the check of my reproach,
And the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer
Knowest thou not this of old,
Since man was placed upon earth
That the triumphing of the wicked is short,
And the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment
Though his excellency mount up to the heavens,
And his head reach unto the clouds
He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found:
Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night
The eye also which saw him shall see him no more;
Neither shall his place any more behold him
His children shall seek to please the poor,
And his hands shall restore their goods
Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,
Though he hide it under his tongue
Though he spare it, and forsake it not;
But keep it still within his mouth
Yet his meat in his bowels is turned,
It is the gall of asps within him
He shall suck the poison of asps:
The viper's tongue shall slay him
He shall not see the rivers,
The floods, the brooks of honey and butter
Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor;
Because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not
Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly,
He shall not save of that which he desired
There shall none of his meat be left;
Therefore shall no man look for his goods
When he is about to fill his belly,
God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him,
And shall rain it upon him while he is eating
He shall flee from the iron weapon,
And the bow of steel shall strike him through
It is drawn, and cometh out of the body;
Yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall:
Terrors are upon him
All darkness shall be hid in his secret places:
A fire not blown shall consume him;
It shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle
The heaven shall reveal his iniquity;
And the earth shall rise up against him
The increase of his house shall depart,
And his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath
This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
And the heritage appointed unto him by God
But Job answered and said
Hear diligently my speech,
And let this be your consolations
Suffer me that I may speak;
And after that I have spoken, mock on
As for me, is my complaint to man
And if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled
Mark me, and be astonished,
And lay your hand upon your mouth
Even when I remember I am afraid,
And trembling taketh hold on my flesh
Wherefore do the wicked live,
Become old, yea, are mighty in power
Their seed is established in their sight with them,
And their offspring before their eyes
Their houses are safe from fear,
Neither is the rod of God upon them
Their bull gendereth, and faileth not;
Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf
They send forth their little ones like a flock,
And their children dance
They take the timbrel and harp,
And rejoice at the sound of the organ
They spend their days in wealth,
And in a moment go down to the grave
Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us;
For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways
Lo, their good is not in their hand:
The counsel of the wicked is far from me
How oft is the candle of the wicked put out
And how oft cometh their destruction upon them
God distributeth sorrows in his anger
They are as stubble before the wind,
And as chaff that the storm carrieth away
His eyes shall see his destruction,
And he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty
For what pleasure hath he in his house after him,
When the number of his months is cut off in the midst
Shall any teach God knowledge
Seeing he judgeth those that are high
One dieth in his full strength,
Being wholly at ease and quiet
His breasts are full of milk,
And his bones are moistened with marrow
And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul,
And never eateth with pleasure
They shall lie down alike in the dust,
And the worms shall cover them
Behold, I know your thoughts,
And the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me
Have ye not asked them that go by the way
And do ye not know their tokens
Who shall declare his way to his face
And who shall repay him what he hath done
Yet shall he be brought to the grave,
And shall remain in the tomb
The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him,
And every man shall draw after him,
As there are innumerable before him
How then comfort ye me in vain,
Seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said
Can a man be profitable unto God,
As he that is wise may be profitable unto himself
Will he reprove thee for fear of thee
Will he enter with thee into judgment
Is not thy wickedness great
And thine iniquities infinite
For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought,
And stripped the naked of their clothing
Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink,
And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry
But as for the mighty man, he had the earth;
And the honourable man dwelt in it
Thou hast sent widows away empty,
And the arms of the fatherless have been broken
Therefore snares are round about thee,
And sudden fear troubleth thee
Or darkness, that thou canst not see;
And abundance of waters cover thee
And thou sayest, How doth God know
Can he judge through the dark cloud
Hast thou marked the old way
Which wicked men have trodden
Which were cut down out of time,
Whose foundation was overflown with a flood
Yet he filled their houses with good things:
But the counsel of the wicked is far from me
The righteous see it, and are glad:
And the innocent laugh them to scorn
Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,
And lay up his words in thine heart
Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust,
And the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks
Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence,
And thou shalt have plenty of silver
Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee,
And thou shalt pay thy vows
Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee:
And the light shall shine upon thy ways
He shall deliver the island of the innocent:
And it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands
Then Job answered and said
Even to day is my complaint bitter:
My stroke is heavier than my groaning
Oh that I knew where I might find him
That I might come even to his seat
I would order my cause before him,
And fill my mouth with arguments
I would know the words which he would answer me,
And understand what he would say unto me
Will he plead against me with his great power
No; but he would put strength in me
There the righteous might dispute with him;
So should I be delivered for ever from my judge
Behold, I go forward, but he is not there;
And backward, but I cannot perceive him
On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:
He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him
But he knoweth the way that I take:
When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold
My foot hath held his steps,
His way have I kept, and not declined
For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me:
And many such things are with him
Therefore am I troubled at his presence:
When I consider, I am afraid of him
For God maketh my heart soft,
And the Almighty troubleth me
Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty,
Do they that know him not see his days
Some remove the landmarks;
They violently take away flocks, and feed thereof
They drive away the ass of the fatherless,
They take the widow's ox for a pledge
They turn the needy out of the way:
The poor of the earth hide themselves together
They reap every one his corn in the field:
And they gather the vintage of the wicked
They cause the naked to lodge without clothing,
That they have no covering in the cold
They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
And embrace the rock for want of a shelter
They pluck the fatherless from the breast,
And take a pledge of the poor
They cause him to go naked without clothing,
And they take away the sheaf from the hungry
Which make oil within their walls,
And tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst
Men groan from out of the city,
And the soul of the wounded crieth out:
Yet God layeth not folly to them
They are of those that rebel against the light;
They know not the ways thereof,
Nor abide in the paths thereof
The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
Saying, No eye shall see me:
And disguiseth his face
In the dark they dig through houses,
Which they had marked for themselves in the daytime:
They know not the light
For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death:
If one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death
He is swift as the waters;
Their portion is cursed in the earth:
He beholdeth not the way of the vineyards
Drought and heat consume the snow waters:
So doth the grave those which have sinned
He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not:
And doeth not good to the widow
Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth;
Yet his eyes are upon their ways
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said
Dominion and fear are with him,
He maketh peace in his high places
Is there any number of his armies
And upon whom doth not his light arise
How much less man, that is a worm
And the son of man, which is a worm
But Job answered and said
How hast thou helped him that is without power
How savest thou the arm that hath no strength
How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom
And how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is
To whom hast thou uttered words
And whose spirit came from thee
Dead things are formed
From under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof
He stretcheth out the north over the empty place,
And hangeth the earth upon nothing
He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds;
And the cloud is not rent under them
He holdeth back the face of his throne,
And spreadeth his cloud upon it
The pillars of heaven tremble
And are astonished at his reproof
He divideth the sea with his power,
And by his understanding he smiteth through the proud
By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens;
His hand hath formed the crooked serpent
Lo, these are parts of his ways:
But how little a portion is heard of him
But the thunder of his power who can understand
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said
My lips shall not speak wickedness,
Nor my tongue utter deceit
God forbid that I should justify you:
Till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me
Let mine enemy be as the wicked,
And he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous
For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
When God taketh away his soul
Will he delight himself in the Almighty
Will he always call upon God
I will teach you by the hand of God:
That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal
Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it;
Why then are ye thus altogether vain
This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
And the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty
If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword:
And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread
Those that remain of him shall be buried in death:
And his widows shall not weep
Though he heap up silver as the dust,
And prepare raiment as the clay
He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on,
And the innocent shall divide the silver
He buildeth his house as a moth,
And as a booth that the keeper maketh
The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered:
He openeth his eyes, and he is not
Terrors take hold on him as waters,
A tempest stealeth him away in the night
The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth:
And as a storm hurleth him out of his place
For God shall cast upon him, and not spare:
He would fain flee out of his hand
Men shall clap their hands at him,
And shall hiss him out of his place
Surely there is a vein for the silver,
And a place for gold where they fine it
Iron is taken out of the earth,
And brass is molten out of the stone
He setteth an end to darkness,
And searcheth out all perfection:
The stones of darkness, and the shadow of death
The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant;
Even the waters forgotten of the foot:
They are dried up, they are gone away from men
As for the earth, out of it cometh bread:
And under it is turned up as it were fire
There is a path which no fowl knoweth,
And which the vulture's eye hath not seen
The lion's whelps have not trodden it,
Nor the fierce lion passed by it
He putteth forth his hand upon the rock;
He overturneth the mountains by the roots
He cutteth out rivers among the rocks;
And his eye seeth every precious thing
He bindeth the floods from overflowing;
And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light
But where shall wisdom be found
And where is the place of understanding
It cannot be gotten for gold,
Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof
It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,
With the precious onyx, or the sapphire
The gold and the crystal cannot equal it:
And the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold
The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,
Neither shall it be valued with pure gold
Whence then cometh wisdom
And where is the place of understanding
Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,
And kept close from the fowls of the air
For he looketh to the ends of the earth,
And seeth under the whole heaven
To make the weight for the winds;
And he weigheth the waters by measure
When he made a decree for the rain,
And a way for the lightning of the thunder
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said
Oh that I were as in months past,
As in the days when God preserved me
When the Almighty was yet with me,
When my children were about me
When I went out to the gate through the city,
When I prepared my seat in the street
The young men saw me, and hid themselves:
And the aged arose, and stood up
The princes refrained talking,
And laid their hand on their mouth
The nobles held their peace,
And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth
When the ear heard me, then it blessed me;
And when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me:
And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me:
My judgment was as a robe and a diadem
I was eyes to the blind,
And feet was I to the lame
I was a father to the poor:
And the cause which I knew not I searched out
And I brake the jaws of the wicked,
And plucked the spoil out of his teeth
Then I said, I shall die in my nest,
And I shall multiply my days as the sand
My root was spread out by the waters,
And the dew lay all night upon my branch
My glory was fresh in me,
And my bow was renewed in my hand
Unto me men gave ear, and waited,
And kept silence at my counsel
After my words they spake not again;
And my speech dropped upon them
And they waited for me as for the rain;
And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain
If I laughed on them, they believed it not;
And the light of my countenance they cast not down
I chose out their way, and sat chief,
And dwelt as a king in the army,
As one that comforteth the mourners
Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me,
In whom old age was perished
They were driven forth from among men,
(They cried after them as after a thief;)
To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys,
in caves of the earth, and in the rocks
Among the bushes they brayed;
Under the nettles they were gathered together
They were children of fools, yea, children of base men:
They were viler than the earth
And now am I their song,
Yea, I am their byword
They abhor me, they flee far from me,
And spare not to spit in my face
Upon my right hand rise the youth;
They push away my feet,
And they raise up against me the ways of their destruction
They mar my path,
They set forward my calamity,
They have no helper
They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters:
In the desolation they rolled themselves upon me
And now my soul is poured out upon me;
The days of affliction have taken hold upon me
My bones are pierced in me in the night season:
And my sinews take no rest
By the great force of my disease is my garment changed:
It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat
He hath cast me into the mire,
And I am become like dust and ashes
I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me:
I stand up, and thou regardest me not
Thou art become cruel to me:
With thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me
For I know that thou wilt bring me to death,
And to the house appointed for all living
Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave,
Though they cry in his destruction
Did not I weep for him that was in trouble
Was not my soul grieved for the poor
When I looked for good, then evil came unto me:
And when I waited for light, there came darkness
My bowels boiled, and rested not:
The days of affliction prevented me
I am a brother to dragons,
And a companion to owls
My skin is black upon me,
And my bones are burned with heat
My harp also is turned to mourning,
And my organ into the voice of them that weep
I made a covenant with mine eyes;
Why then should I think upon a maid
Is not destruction to the wicked
And a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity
Doth not he see my ways,
And count all my steps
If I have walked with vanity,
Or if my foot hath hasted to deceit
Let me be weighed in an even balance,
That God may know mine integrity
If my step hath turned out of the way,
And mine heart walked after mine eyes,
And if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands
Then let me sow, and let another eat;
Yea, let my offspring be rooted out
If mine heart have been deceived by a woman,
Or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door
Then let my wife grind unto another,
And let others bow down upon her
For this is an heinous crime;
Yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges
For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction,
And would root out all mine increase
If I have withheld the poor from their desire,
Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail
Or have eaten my morsel myself alone,
And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof
(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father,
And I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
Or any poor without covering
If his loins have not blessed me,
And if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep
If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
When I saw my help in the gate
Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade,
And mine arm be broken from the bone
For destruction from God was a terror to me,
And by reason of his highness I could not endure
If I have made gold my hope,
Or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence
If I rejoiced because my wealth was great,
And because mine hand had gotten much
If I beheld the sun when it shined,
Or the moon walking in brightness
And my heart hath been secretly enticed,
Or my mouth hath kissed my hand
This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge:
For I should have denied the God that is above
If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me,
Or lifted up myself when evil found him
Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin
By wishing a curse to his soul
If the men of my tabernacle said not,
Oh that we had of his flesh
The stranger did not lodge in the street:
But I opened my doors to the traveller
If I covered my transgressions as Adam,
By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom
Did I fear a great multitude,
Or did the contempt of families terrify me,
That I kept silence, and went not out of the door
Surely I would take it upon my shoulder,
And bind it as a crown to me
I would declare unto him the number of my steps;
As a prince would I go near unto him
If my land cry against me,
Or that the furrows likewise thereof complain
If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,
Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life
Let thistles grow instead of wheat,
And cockle instead of barley
The words of Job are ended
So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes
Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God
Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said,
I am young, and ye are very old;
Wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion
Great men are not always wise:
Neither do the aged understand judgment
Therefore I said, Hearken to me;
I also will shew mine opinion
Behold, I waited for your words;
I gave ear to your reasons,
Whilst ye searched out what to say
Now he hath not directed his words against me:
Neither will I answer him with your speeches
They were amazed, they answered no more:
They left off speaking
When I had waited, (for they spake not,
But stood still, and answered no more;)
I said, I will answer also my part,
I also will shew mine opinion
For I am full of matter,
The spirit within me constraineth me
Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent;
It is ready to burst like new bottles
I will speak, that I may be refreshed:
I will open my lips and answer
Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person,
Neither let me give flattering titles unto man
Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches,
And hearken to all my words
Behold, now I have opened my mouth,
My tongue hath spoken in my mouth
My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart:
And my lips shall utter knowledge clearly
The Spirit of God hath made me,
And the breath of the Almighty hath given me life
If thou canst answer me,
Set thy words in order before me, stand up
Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead:
I also am formed out of the clay
Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid,
Neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee
Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing,
And I have heard the voice of thy words, saying
I am clean without transgression,
I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me
Behold, he findeth occasions against me,
He counteth me for his enemy
Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee,
that God is greater than man
Why dost thou strive against him
For he giveth not account of any of his matters
For God speaketh once,
Yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not
In a dream, in a vision of the night,
When deep sleep falleth upon men,
In slumberings upon the bed
Then he openeth the ears of men,
And sealeth their instruction
That he may withdraw man from his purpose,
And hide pride from man
He keepeth back his soul from the pit,
And his life from perishing by the sword
So that his life abhorreth bread,
And his soul dainty meat
His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;
And his bones that were not seen stick out
Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave,
And his life to the destroyers
If there be a messenger with him,
An interpreter, one among a thousand,
To shew unto man his uprightness
His flesh shall be fresher than a child's:
He shall return to the days of his youth
He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him:
And he shall see his face with joy:
For he will render unto man his righteousness
He looketh upon men, and if any say,
I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,
And it profited me not
Lo, all these things worketh God
Oftentimes with man
To bring back his soul from the pit,
To be enlightened with the light of the living
Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me:
Hold thy peace, and I will speak
If thou hast any thing to say, answer me:
Speak, for I desire to justify thee
For the ear trieth words,
As the mouth tasteth meat
Let us choose to us judgment:
Let us know among ourselves what is good
For Job hath said, I am righteous:
And God hath taken away my judgment
Should I lie against my right
My wound is incurable without transgression
What man is like Job,
Who drinketh up scorning like water
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,
And walketh with wicked men
Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding:
Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness;
And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity
For the work of a man shall he render unto him,
And cause every man to find according to his ways
Who hath given him a charge over the earth
Or who hath disposed the whole world
If he set his heart upon man,
If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath
All flesh shall perish together,
And man shall turn again unto dust
If now thou hast understanding, hear this:
Hearken to the voice of my words
Shall even he that hateth right govern
And wilt thou condemn him that is most just
How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes,
Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor
For they all are the work of his hands
In a moment shall they die,
And the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away:
And the mighty shall be taken away without hand
For his eyes are upon the ways of man,
And he seeth all his goings
There is no darkness, nor shadow of death,
Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves
For he will not lay upon man more than right;
That he should enter into judgment with God
He shall break in pieces mighty men without number,
And set others in their stead
Therefore he knoweth their works,
And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed
He striketh them as wicked men
In the open sight of others
Because they turned back from him,
And would not consider any of his ways
So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him,
And he heareth the cry of the afflicted
That the hypocrite reign not,
Lest the people be ensnared
Surely it is meet to be said unto God,
I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more
Should it be according to thy mind
He will recompense it, whether thou refuse,
Or whether thou choose; and not I:
Therefore speak what thou knowest
Let men of understanding tell me,
And let a wise man hearken unto me
My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end
Because of his answers for wicked men
Elihu spake moreover, and said
I will answer thee,
And thy companions with thee
Look unto the heavens, and see;
And behold the clouds which are higher than thou
If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him
Or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him
If thou be righteous, what givest thou him
Or what receiveth he of thine hand
Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art;
And thy righteousness may profit the son of man
By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry:
They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty
There they cry, but none giveth answer,
Because of the pride of evil men
But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger;
Yet he knoweth it not in great extremity
Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain;
He multiplieth words without knowledge
Elihu also proceeded, and said
Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee
That I have yet to speak on God's behalf
I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker
For truly my words shall not be false:
He that is perfect in knowledge is with thee
Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any:
He is mighty in strength and wisdom
He preserveth not the life of the wicked:
But giveth right to the poor
He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:
But with kings are they on the throne;
Yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted
And if they be bound in fetters,
And be holden in cords of affliction
Then he sheweth them their work,
And their transgressions that they have exceeded
He openeth also their ear to discipline,
And commandeth that they return from iniquity
But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword,
And they shall die without knowledge
Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait
Into a broad place, where there is no straitness;
And that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness
Desire not the night,
When people are cut off in their place
Take heed, regard not iniquity:
For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction
Behold, God exalteth by his power:
Who teacheth like him
Remember that thou magnify his work,
Which men behold
Every man may see it;
Man may behold it afar off
Behold, God is great, and we know him not,
Neither can the number of his years be searched out
For he maketh small the drops of water:
They pour down rain according to the vapour thereof
Which the clouds do drop
And distil upon man abundantly
Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,
Or the noise of his tabernacle
Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it,
And covereth the bottom of the sea
For by them judgeth he the people;
He giveth meat in abundance
With clouds he covereth the light;
And commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt
At this also my heart trembleth,
And is moved out of his place
Hear attentively the noise of his voice,
And the sound that goeth out of his mouth
He directeth it under the whole heaven,
And his lightning unto the ends of the earth
After it a voice roareth:
He thundereth with the voice of his excellency;
And he will not stay them when his voice is heard
God thundereth marvellously with his voice;
Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend
For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth;
And to the great rain of his strength
He sealeth up the hand of every man;
That all men may know his work
Then the beasts go into dens,
And remain in their places
Out of the south cometh the whirlwind:
And cold out of the north
By the breath of God frost is given:
And the breadth of the waters is straitened
Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud:
He scattereth his bright cloud
And it is turned round about by his counsels:
That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them
Upon the face of the world in the earth
Dost thou know when God disposed them,
And caused the light of his cloud to shine
Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,
The wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge
Hast thou with him spread out the sky,
Which is strong, and as a molten looking glass
Teach us what we shall say unto him;
For we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness
Shall it be told him that I speak
If a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up
Fair weather cometh out of the north:
With God is terrible majesty
Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out:
He is excellent in power, and in judgment,
And in plenty of justice: he will not afflict
Men do therefore fear him:
He respecteth not any that are wise of heart
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said
Who is this that darkeneth counsel
By words without knowledge
Gird up now thy loins like a man;
For I will demand of thee, and answer thou me
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth
Declare, if thou hast understanding
Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest
Or who hath stretched the line upon it
Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened
Or who laid the corner stone thereof
When the morning stars sang together,
And all the sons of God shouted for joy
Or who shut up the sea with doors,
When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb
When I made the cloud the garment thereof,
And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it
And brake up for it my decreed place,
And set bars and doors
Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;
And caused the dayspring to know his place
It is turned as clay to the seal;
And they stand as a garment
And from the wicked their light is withholden,
And the high arm shall be broken
Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea
Or hast thou walked in the search of the depth
Have the gates of death been opened unto thee
Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death
Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth
Declare if thou knowest it all
Where is the way where light dwelleth
And as for darkness, where is the place thereof
That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,
And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof
Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow
Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail
Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,
Against the day of battle and war
By what way is the light parted,
Which scattereth the east wind upon the earth
Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,
Or a way for the lightning of thunder
To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is;
On the wilderness, wherein there is no man
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground;
And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth
Hath the rain a father
Or who hath begotten the drops of dew
The waters are hid as with a stone,
And the face of the deep is frozen
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades,
Or loose the bands of Orion
Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season
Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons
Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven
Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth
Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
That abundance of waters may cover thee
Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts
Or who hath given understanding to the heart
Who can number the clouds in wisdom
Or who can stay the bottles of heaven
Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion
Or fill the appetite of the young lions
When they couch in their dens,
And abide in the covert to lie in wait
Who provideth for the raven his food
When his young ones cry unto God,
They wander for lack of meat
Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth
Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve
Canst thou number the months that they fulfil
Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth
They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones,
They cast out their sorrows
Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;
They go forth, and return not unto them
Who hath sent out the wild ass free
Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass
Whose house I have made the wilderness,
And the barren land his dwellings
He scorneth the multitude of the city,
Neither regardeth he the crying of the driver
The range of the mountains is his pasture,
And he searcheth after every green thing
Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee,
Or abide by thy crib
Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow
Or will he harrow the valleys after thee
Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great
Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him
Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed,
And gather it into thy barn
Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks
Or wings and feathers unto the ostrich
Which leaveth her eggs in the earth,
And warmeth them in dust
And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,
Or that the wild beast may break them
She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's:
Her labour is in vain without fear
What time she lifteth up herself on high,
She scorneth the horse and his rider
Hast thou given the horse strength
Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder
Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper
The glory of his nostrils is terrible
He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength:
He goeth on to meet the armed men
He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted;
Neither turneth he back from the sword
The quiver rattleth against him,
The glittering spear and the shield
He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage:
Neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet
He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha;
And he smelleth the battle afar off,
The thunder of the captains, and the shouting
Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom,
And stretch her wings toward the south
Doth the eagle mount up at thy command,
And make her nest on high
She dwelleth and abideth on the rock,
Upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place
From thence she seeketh the prey,
And her eyes behold afar off
Her young ones also suck up blood:
And where the slain are, there is she
Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said
Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him
He that reproveth God, let him answer it
Then Job answered the LORD, and said
Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee
I will lay mine hand upon my mouth
Once have I spoken; but I will not answer:
Yea, twice; but I will proceed no further
Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said
Wilt thou also disannul my judgment
Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous
Hast thou an arm like God
Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him
Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency;
And array thyself with glory and beauty
Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath:
And behold every one that is proud, and abase him
Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low;
And tread down the wicked in their place
Hide them in the dust together;
And bind their faces in secret
Then will I also confess unto thee
That thine own right hand can save thee
Lo now, his strength is in his loins,
And his force is in the navel of his belly
He moveth his tail like a cedar:
The sinews of his stones are wrapped together
His bones are as strong pieces of brass;
His bones are like bars of iron
He is the chief of the ways of God:
He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him
Surely the mountains bring him forth food,
Where all the beasts of the field play
He lieth under the shady trees,
In the covert of the reed, and fens
The shady trees cover him with their shadow;
The willows of the brook compass him about
Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not:
He trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth
He taketh it with his eyes:
His nose pierceth through snares
Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook
Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down
Canst thou put an hook into his nose
Or bore his jaw through with a thorn
Will he make many supplications unto thee
Will he speak soft words unto thee
Wilt thou play with him as with a bird
Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens
Shall the companions make a banquet of him
Shall they part him among the merchants
Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons
Or his head with fish spears
Lay thine hand upon him,
Remember the battle, do no more
Behold, the hope of him is in vain:
Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him
None is so fierce that dare stir him up:
Who then is able to stand before me
Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him
Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine
I will not conceal his parts,
Nor his power, nor his comely proportion
Who can open the doors of his face
His teeth are terrible round about
One is so near to another,
That no air can come between them
They are joined one to another,
They stick together, that they cannot be sundered
By his neesings a light doth shine,
And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning
Out of his mouth go burning lamps,
And sparks of fire leap out
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke,
As out of a seething pot or caldron
His breath kindleth coals,
And a flame goeth out of his mouth
His heart is as firm as a stone;
Yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone
When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid:
By reason of breakings they purify themselves
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold:
The spear, the dart, nor the habergeon
He esteemeth iron as straw,
And brass as rotten wood
Darts are counted as stubble:
He laugheth at the shaking of a spear
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:
He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment
He maketh a path to shine after him;
One would think the deep to be hoary
Upon earth there is not his like,
Who is made without fear
He beholdeth all high things:
He is a king over all the children of pride
Then Job answered the LORD, and said
I know that thou canst do every thing,
And that no thought can be withholden from thee
I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear:
But now mine eye seeth thee
Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent
In dust and ashes
So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job
And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before
So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses
He had also seven sons and three daughters
And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch
And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren
After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations
So Job died, being old and full of days
Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying
Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel
Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses
From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast
There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee
Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them
Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest
This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success
Have not I commanded thee
Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest
Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying
And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying
Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land
Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them
And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go
According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses
And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country
And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were
and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them
But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof
And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof
and she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you
For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed
And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath
Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token
and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death
Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall
And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way
And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear
Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee
And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him
And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear
And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not
So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them
And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over
And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host
and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it
Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore
And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you
And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people
And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people
And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee
And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan
And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan
Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man
And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people
that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho
And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan
And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying
Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man
and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night
Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man
and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel
Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever
And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there
And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day
For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over
And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people
And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them
about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho
On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life
And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying
Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan
Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan
And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before
And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho
And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal
And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones
Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land
that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever
And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel
At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time
And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins
And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt
Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised
And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way
And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole
And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho
And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day
And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year
And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries
And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy
And Joshua did so
Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in
And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour
And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him
And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD
And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them
And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets
And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout
So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp
And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD
And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets
And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days
And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times
And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city
And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent
And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it
But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD
And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword
But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her
And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel
And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD
And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho
So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country
But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel
And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country
And the men went up and viewed Ai
And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few
So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai
And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water
And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads
And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us
would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan
For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face
Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff
In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man
And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel
So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken
and he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken
and he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken
When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it
So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it
And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD
And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor
And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us
the LORD shall trouble thee this day
And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land
So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night
And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready
and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them
(for they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them
Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand
Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people
And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai
And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai
And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city
And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness
And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire
And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai
And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua
And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword
And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai
For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai
Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua
And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day
And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day
as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings
And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel
And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel
And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law
There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them
And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof
that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord
And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai
they did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up
and old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy
And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants
And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye
And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt
and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth
This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy
and these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey
And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD
And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them
And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel
And all the congregation murmured against the princes
But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them
And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us
Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God
And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do
And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not
And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose
Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them
that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty
Wherefore Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying
Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel
Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it
So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee
Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night
And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah
And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword
Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel,
Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon;
And thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal
But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah
And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah
And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them
and stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand
And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities
And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel
Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave
And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon
And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening
And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day
And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho
Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah
and the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho
And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it
and the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah
Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining
And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it
and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish
And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it
and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it
and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king
And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon
And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal
And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west
and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh
And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many
And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire
So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them
And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire
And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms
And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire
And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded
But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn
And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe
As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses
even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them
Joshua made war a long time with all those kings
There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle
For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses
And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities
There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained
So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes
And the land rested from war
Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east
Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon
and from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdoth-pisgah
and the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei
and reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon
Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh
And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions
in the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites
Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed
This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri
from Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites
from the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites
and the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath
Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh
with whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them
from Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon
and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah
all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out
Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day
Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them
And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families
And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba
Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon
and Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar in the mount of the valley
and Beth-peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth
and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country
Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them
And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the children of Gad according to their families
And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah
and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir
and in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward
This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages
And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families
And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities
and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families
These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward
But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them
And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them
By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe
For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them
For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance
As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land
Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea
Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart
Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God
And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God
And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old
As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in
Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said
And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance
Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel
And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims
And the land had rest from war
This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast
And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward
and it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa
And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan
And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan
and the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben
and the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel
and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjath-jearim
and the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah
and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea
And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak
And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher
And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife
And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife
And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families
And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur
and Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor
and Hazar-gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth-palet
and Hazar-shual, and Beer-sheba, and Bizjothjah
and Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages
And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah
and Zanoah, and En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam
and Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages
Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal-gad
and Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages
Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan
and Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages
Ekron, with her towns and her villages
from Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages
Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof
And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh
and Dannah, and Kirjath-sannah, which is Debir
and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages
and Janum, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah
and Humtah, and Kirjath-arba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine cities with their villages
Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages
Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor
and Maarath, and Beth-anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages
Kirjath-baal, which is Kirjath-jearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages
in the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah
and Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages
As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day
And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Beth-el
and goeth out from Beth-el to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth
and goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings out thereof are at the sea
So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance
And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper
and the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah
and it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan
And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages
And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute
There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan
But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah
And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren
Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father
And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan
And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah
Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim
and the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea
southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east
Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land
Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out
And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Beth-shean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel
And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only
but the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong
And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance
And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you
Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me
And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north
Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God
And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh
And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions
And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph
And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven
And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which is Kirjath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter
And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah
and the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel
and was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben
and passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah
and the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast
Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz
and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el
and Chephar-haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages
Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth
and Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages
This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families
And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah
And they had in their inheritance Beer-sheba, and Sheba, and Moladah
and Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Azem
and Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah
Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages
Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them
And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid
and their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam
and turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and goeth up to Japhia
and from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittah-hepher, to Ittah-kazin, and goeth out to Remmon-methoar to Neah
and the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthah-el
and Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Beth-lehem: twelve cities with their villages
This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages
And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families
And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem
and Remeth, and En-gannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez
and the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Beth-shemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages
And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families
And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph
and turneth toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, and reacheth to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthah-el toward the north side of Beth-emek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand
and Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Zidon
and then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib
Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages
The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families
And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan
and then the coast turneth westward to Aznoth-tabor, and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising
And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth

and Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages
And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families
And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh
and Jehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon
and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages
When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them
according to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein
These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
So they made an end of dividing the country
The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying
Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses
that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood
And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them
And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime
And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled
And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah
And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh
Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel
and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle
And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs
And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities
And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities
The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities
And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses
And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name
which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for their's was the first lot
And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it
But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession
and Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs
and Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs

And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs
Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities
All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs
And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim
For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs
and Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Beth-horon with her suburbs; four cities
And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs

And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with her suburbs; two cities
All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained

And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs

So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities
All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs
These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus were all these cities
There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass
Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh
ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God
And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan
But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul
So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents
And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses
And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to
And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel
And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them
And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest
and with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel
And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying
Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD
but that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD
and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel
Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God
Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel
that we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it
Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice
Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you
God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle
And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again
And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt
And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God
And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age
And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age
and ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you
And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you
Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left
that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them
but cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day
For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day
One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you
Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God
Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you
know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you
And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof
Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you
When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you
And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods
And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac
And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt
I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out
And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea
Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you
but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand
And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand
And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow
Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD
And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods
for the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed
And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD
And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him
And they said, We are witnesses
Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel
So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem
And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God
So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance
And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old
And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash
And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel
And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph
And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim
And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock
If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD
And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him
And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces
And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire
and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar
And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish
And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar
And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons
And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar
and he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes
And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon
and he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD
And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil
And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil
Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering
And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil
And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar
And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD
And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire
No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire
And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears
And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering
And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD
And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards
and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away
And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD
And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish
If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD
And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards
and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away
And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD
And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD
And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards
and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away
And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the LORD's
It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them
If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering
And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD
And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary
And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards
and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away
as it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering
And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung
even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt
And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty
when the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation
And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD
And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation
and the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail
And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar
And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation
When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty
or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering
And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering
And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him
And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty
And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering
And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar

and he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him
Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty
Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty
Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these
And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin
And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering
and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering
And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him
Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin offering
And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
and he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him
And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity
It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour
or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein
then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found
And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest
and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar
And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place
The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out
And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar
And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD
And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night
And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt
For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation
Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place
But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water
All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy
And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire
Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy
In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar
And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards
and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away
and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering
As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it
And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered
And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another
And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD
Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings
And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings
And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning
But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten
but the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire
And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity
But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people
Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat
And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it
For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people
Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings
Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings
His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD
And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'
And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings
He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part
For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel
This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office
which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations
This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings
which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread
and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be done
And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water
And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith
And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim
And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses
And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them
And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them
And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him
And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses
And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it
And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar
But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses
And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram
And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about
And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat
And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses
And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram
And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot
And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about
And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder
and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder
And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD
And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses
And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it
And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire
And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you
As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you
Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded
So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses
And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel
and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD
also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you
And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD
And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you
And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded
Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself
And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar
but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses
And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp
And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar
And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar
And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar
And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner
And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning
and the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver
and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar
and the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded
And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings
And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD
Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified
And Aaron held his peace
So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said
And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled
And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you
And they did according to the word of Moses
And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying
and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean
and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses
and ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded
And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel
The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded
And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying
Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded
And when Moses heard that, he was content
And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth
Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat
Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you
And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you
And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you
And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you
Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you
These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat
And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you
they shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination
Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you
And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray
and the vulture, and the kite after his kind
every raven after his kind
and the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind
and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl
and the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle
and the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat
All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you
Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth
even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind
But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you
And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even
And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even
The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean
And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even
And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you
These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind
and the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole
These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even
And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed
And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it
Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean
Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean
And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean
But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you
And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even
And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even
And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten
Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination
For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy
This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth
to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean
And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised
And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled
But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days
And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying
When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests
and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean
If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days
But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again
and if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy
When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest
and the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising
it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean
And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh
then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean
But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean
Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest
and the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean
The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed
and in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest
and if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil
But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days
and if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague
But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean
Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white
then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy
But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days
and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy
And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning
If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard
then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard
And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin
he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean
But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing
then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean
But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean
If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots
And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean
And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean
And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead
he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head
And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean
All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be
The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment
whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin
and if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest
and the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the plague seven days
He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire
And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more
And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof
and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire
And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest
and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water
as for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water
and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field
And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days
But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean
And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD

and the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand
and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD
and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering
And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil
and two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering
And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD
And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD
and he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot

even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD
This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying
When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession
and he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house
then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house
and he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall
then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days
and the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house
then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city
and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place
and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house
And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered
then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean
And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place
Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even
And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes
And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed
And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop
and he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water
and he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times
and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet
This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall
and for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house
and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot
to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy

Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering
He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on
And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering
And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house
And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat
And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering

And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself

and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times

And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel
And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about
And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel
And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat
and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness

And he did as the LORD commanded Moses
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people
And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD
And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring
This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations
And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people
And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people
For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul
Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood
And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust
For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof; therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off
And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean
But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God
Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God
Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD

Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time
Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness
Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her
And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD
Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination
Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you
and the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants
Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you
(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)
that the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you
For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people
Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy
Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God
Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God
And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will
It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire
And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted
Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people
Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another
And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD
Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD
Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD
Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him
Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD
And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free
And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering
And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him
And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of
But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal
And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God
Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times
Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard
Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD
Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD
Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God
Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD
And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him
Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure
Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt
Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name
And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not
then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people
And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people
Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God
And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you
And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death
And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them
And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you
And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast
And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity
And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people
And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity
And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless
Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out
And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them
But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people
Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean
And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine
A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them
And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people
but for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother
and for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled
They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh
They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy
They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God
And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire
And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes
neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother
neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD
And he shall take a wife in her virginity
A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife
Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous
or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded
or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken
no man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God
He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy
Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them
And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD
What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean
And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him
the soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water
And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food
That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the LORD
They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them
There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing
But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat
If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things
And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing
And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD
or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering
ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats
But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you
Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD
Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted
Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day
And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will
Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD
Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you
that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts
These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons
In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein
But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest
and he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it
And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD
And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete
even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD
Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD
And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD
Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings
And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation
Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD
And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God
For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people
And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people
Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings
It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD
On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein
Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath
And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days
Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God
And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually
Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations
And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD
And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD
Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant
And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute
And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp
and the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the LORD, and cursed
And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)
and they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin
And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death
And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast
And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him
breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again
And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death
Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God
And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones
And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses
And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD
Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof
but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard
That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land
And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee
And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years
Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land
And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family
A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed
For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field
In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession
And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another
according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee
according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee
Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety
And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety
then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years
And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store
The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me
And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land
If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold
And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it
then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession
But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession
And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile
But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile
Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time
And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel
But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession
And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee
Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee
Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase
I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God
And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant
but as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile
For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen
Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God
Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids
And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family
either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself
And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him
And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption
And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight
And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him
Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God
Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD
If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them
then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit
And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely
And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land
And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword
And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword
For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you
And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you
And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people
I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright
But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments
and if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant
And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you
And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins
And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass
and your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits
And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins
I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate
And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me
then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins
And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied
And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me
then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins
And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat
And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you
And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours
And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it
And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste
Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths
As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it
And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies
And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up
If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me
and that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity
then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land
The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes
But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation
And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary
And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels
And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels
And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver
And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels
And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy
He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy
But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation
And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his
And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver
If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand
But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation
And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him
And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more
And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession
then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD
In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong
Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's
None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death
And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD
And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof
And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD
He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed
These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai
that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem
And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire
And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven
and said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments
let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned
We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses
Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations
but if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there
Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand
Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request
So I prayed to the God of heaven
Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah
and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into
And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me
When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel
So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days
And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon
And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire
Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass
Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned
And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work
Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me
And they said, Let us rise up and build
So they strengthened their hands for this good work
Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem
But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof
And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord
Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof
And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river
And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem
Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahath-moab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces
And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters
But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Beth-haccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof
But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David
After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Beth-zur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty
After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah
And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall
After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest
After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib
And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain
After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even unto the corner
Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out
After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel
From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house
After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner
And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants
But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews
And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews
will they fortify themselves
will they sacrifice
will they make an end in a day
will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned
Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall
and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders
So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work
But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth
and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it
Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them
And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall
And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease
And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you
Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows
And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses
And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work
And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah
They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon
And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another
In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us
So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared
Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day
So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing
And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews
For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live
Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth
There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards
Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards
And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words
Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother
And I set a great assembly against them
And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren
or shall they be sold unto us
Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer
Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies
I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury
Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them
Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest
Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise
Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied
And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD
And the people did according to this promise
Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor
But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God
Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work
Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us
Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)
And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you
Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner
Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand
wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words
Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee
And I said, Should such a man as I flee
and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life
I will not go in
So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days
And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God
Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them
For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah
Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him
And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear
Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed
that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many
And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house
Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded
These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city
who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah

the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon
All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two
And these were they which went up also from Tel-melah, Tel-haresha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel
The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two
And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim
The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore
beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women
Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred forty and five
their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses
And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work
The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments
And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver
And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments
And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel
And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month
And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam
And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up
and Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God
And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground
Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place
So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading
And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep
For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law
So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved
And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them
And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law
And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month
and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written
So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim
And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so
And there was very great gladness
Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God
And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner
Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them
And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers
And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God
Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God
and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous
and didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea
Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go
Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments
and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant
and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them
But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments
Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations
yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go
Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst
Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not
Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan
Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it
So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would
And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness
Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations
Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies
Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands
Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God
Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly
neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them
For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works
Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it
and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress
And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it
And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge, and having understanding
they clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes
and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons
and if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt
Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God
for the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God
And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law
and to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the LORD
also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God
and that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage
And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house
And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities
And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem
Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants

And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer: and Bakbukiah the second among his brethren, and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun
All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four
Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that kept the gates, were an hundred seventy and two
And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance
But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims
For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day
And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people

And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin

And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward
Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates
These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe
And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps
And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi
also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem
And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall
and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah
and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam

And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward

So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me
and the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets
Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off
And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited
And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son
For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God
And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron
On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever
because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing
Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude
And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah
and he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests
But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king
and I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God
And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber
Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense
And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field
Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken
And I gathered them together, and set them in their place
Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries
And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren
There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem
And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day
So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice
And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day
Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy
In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab
and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people
And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves
Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives
And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me
Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying
Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls

So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel
even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty
But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them
For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying
Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel
but thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle
And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death
And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts
But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony
And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying
Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch
And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred
And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred
Then the tribe of Zebulun: and Eliab the son of Helon shall be captain of the children of Zebulun

And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty thousand and five hundred
And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred

But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses
And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so they set forward, every one after their families, according to the house of their fathers
These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai
And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar
These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office

Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him
And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle
And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle

All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand
And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names
And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel
And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen

And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites
thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:)
and thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons

This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things
and when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it

And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying
Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites
but thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden
but they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying

even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore
According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as the LORD commanded Moses
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead
both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell
And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty
then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed
But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him
And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his
And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him
and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner
and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled
then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance
And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water
and the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse
and the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse
but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband
then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell
And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water
Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water
And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people
or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law
Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried
All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk
All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow
All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall come at no dead body
He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is upon his head
All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD
And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it
And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day
And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled
and he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings
and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings
And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering
and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering
And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings
And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them
And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them
And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them
that the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites
Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service
and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest
But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders
And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar
And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar
And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah
and his offering was one silver charger, the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them were full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering
one spoon of ten shekels of gold, full of incense
one young bullock, one ram, one lamb of the first year, for a burnt offering

one young bullock, one ram, one lamb of the first year, for a burnt offering
one kid of the goats for a sin offering
On the third day Eliab the son of Helon, prince of the children of Zebulun, did offer

And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubims: and he spake unto him
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick
And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses
And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them
And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean
Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering
And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together
and thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites
and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the LORD
And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites
And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD
Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine
For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me
For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself
And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel
And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary
And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them
And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them
And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more
but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service
Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying
Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season
In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it
And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover
And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel
And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day
and those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel
And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD
The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it
But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin
And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning
So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night
And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents
And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not
And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed
And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed
Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed
At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps
And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee
When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward
When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys
But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm
And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies
Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God
And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony
And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran
And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel
And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came
And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan
Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward
And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred
And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes
And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee
And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them
And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp
And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched
And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them
And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat
We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick
And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium
And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil
And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it
Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased
And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant
and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me
Have I conceived all this people
have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers
Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people
for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat
I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me
And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness
And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee
And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone
Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days
but even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt
And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month
Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them
or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them
And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short
thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not
And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle
And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp
And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them
And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel
And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth
And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp
And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague
And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted
And the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth
And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman
And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses
hath he not spoken also by us
And the LORD heard it
And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth
My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed
And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous
And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned
Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb
And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days
let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again
And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again
And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel
Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori
Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh
Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph
Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun
Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu
Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi
Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi
Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli
Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael
Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi
Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi
These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land
And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua
And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain
and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many
and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds
So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath
And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs
The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence
And they returned from searching of the land after forty days
And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land
And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it
Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there
The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan
And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it
But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we
And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature
And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight
And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night
And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt
Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel
And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes
and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land
Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not
I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they
And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)
Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying
Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness
And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying
The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation
Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now
And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word
but as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD
Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice
surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it
but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying
How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me
I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me
Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you
your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me
doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun
But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised
But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness
And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness
After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise
I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die
And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land
even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD
But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still
And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly
And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned
And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD
but it shall not prosper
Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies
For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you
But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp
Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you
and will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock
then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil
And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb
Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil
And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD
And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD
then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil
And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD
Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid
According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number
All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD
And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do
One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you
then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD
Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it
Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations
And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses
even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations
then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering
And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance
and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance
And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering
And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him
Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them
But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people
Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him
And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day
And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation
And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him
And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp
And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue
and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring
that ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God
Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men
and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown
And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face
and he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him
This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company
And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi
seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them
And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also
And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up
And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them
And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow
And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron
And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying
Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram
And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him
And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins
And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind
If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me
But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD
And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them
and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods
They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation
And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also
And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed
And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar
to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses
But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD
And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared
And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment
And they fell upon their faces
And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun
And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed
Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah
And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod
And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers
And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you
And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you
And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods
And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness
And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds
And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he
And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish
Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying
And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood
And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness
And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die
And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you
And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel
And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever
This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of their's, every meat offering of their's, and every sin offering of their's, and every trespass offering of their's, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons
In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee
All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee
And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it
Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine
Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem
And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine
All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee
And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel
And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die
But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe
And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress
Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest
Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it
Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress
And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation
And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying
This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke
and ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face
and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times
and one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn
and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer
Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even
And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even
And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin
He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days
He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean
This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days
And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean
And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days
And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel
and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave
and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even
And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even
And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron
And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD
And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there
And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink
And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them
This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them
how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers
Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him
And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying
Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah
Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor
and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there
And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation
And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel
And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners
And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities
And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness
for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread
And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died
And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived
And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth
And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising
From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared
From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites
And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water
The princes digged the well,
The nobles of the people digged it,
By the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves
And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah
and from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth
and from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon
And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying
Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders
And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel
And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong
And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof
For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon
Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say,
Come into Heshbon,
Let the city of Sihon be built and prepared
For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon,
A flame from the city of Sihon:
It hath consumed Ar of Moab,
And the lords of the high places of Arnon
Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites
And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there
And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei
And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon
So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land
And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho
And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites
And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel
And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field
And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time
He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me
And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak
And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee
And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying
And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us
And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they
And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me
And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more
Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more
And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do
And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab
And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way
But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side
And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again
And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left
And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times
And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day
was I ever wont to do so unto thee
And he said, Nay
And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times
behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me
and the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive
And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again
And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak
So Balaam went with the princes of Balak
And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast
And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee
wherefore camest thou not unto me
am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour
And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth
And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him
And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people
And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams
And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram
And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee
And he went to an high place
And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram
And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab
And he took up his parable, and said,
Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram,
Out of the mountains of the east,
Saying, Come, curse me Jacob,
And come, defy Israel
How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed
Or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied
For from the top of the rocks I see him,
And from the hills I behold him:
Lo, the people shall dwell alone,
And shall not be reckoned among the nations
Who can count the dust of Jacob,
And the number of the fourth part of Israel
Let me die the death of the righteous,
And let my last end be like his
And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me
I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether
And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth
And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar
And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus
And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him
And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken
God is not a man, that he should lie;
Neither the son of man, that he should repent:
Hath he said, and shall he not do it
Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good
He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob,
Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel:
The LORD his God is with him,
And the shout of a king is among them
God brought them out of Egypt;
He hath as it were the strength of an unicorn
Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion,
And lift up himself as a young lion:
He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,
And drink the blood of the slain
And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all
But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do
And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence
And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon
And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams
And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar
And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness
And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him
He hath said, which heard the words of God,
Which saw the vision of the Almighty,
Falling into a trance, but having his eyes open
How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,
And thy tabernacles, O Israel
As the valleys are they spread forth,
As gardens by the river's side,
As the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted,
And as cedar trees beside the waters
He shall pour the water out of his buckets,
And his seed shall be in many waters,
And his king shall be higher than Agag,
And his kingdom shall be exalted
And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times
And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying
If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak
And he took up his parable, and said,
Balaam the son of Beor hath said,
And the man whose eyes are open hath said
He hath said, which heard the words of God,
And knew the knowledge of the Most High,
Which saw the vision of the Almighty,
Falling into a trance, but having his eyes open
I shall see him, but not now:
I shall behold him, but not nigh:
There shall come a Star out of Jacob,
And a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel,
And shall smite the corners of Moab,
And destroy all the children of Sheth
Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion,
And shall destroy him that remaineth of the city
And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,
Amalek was the first of the nations;
But his latter end shall be that he perish for ever
And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,
Strong is thy dwellingplace,
And thou puttest thy nest in a rock
Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted,
Until Asshur shall carry thee away captive
And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim,
And shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber,
And he also shall perish for ever
And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab
And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods
And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel
And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel
And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor
And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand
And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy
Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace
and he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel
Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites
And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Vex the Midianites, and smite them
for they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake
And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying
Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel
And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying
Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt
These are the families of the Reubenites: and they that were numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty
And the sons of Pallu; Eliab
And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram
This is that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the LORD
and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign
Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not
These are the families of the Simeonites, twenty and two thousand and two hundred
These are the families of the children of Gad according to those that were numbered of them, forty thousand and five hundred
The sons of Judah were Er and Onan: and Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan
These are the families of Judah according to those that were numbered of them, threescore and sixteen thousand and five hundred
These are the families of Issachar according to those that were numbered of them, threescore and four thousand and three hundred
These are the families of the Zebulunites according to those that were numbered of them, threescore thousand and five hundred
The sons of Joseph after their families were Manasseh and Ephraim
These are the families of Manasseh, and those that were numbered of them, fifty and two thousand and seven hundred
These are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those that were numbered of them, thirty and two thousand and five hundred
These are the sons of Joseph after their families
All the families of the Shuhamites, according to those that were numbered of them, were threescore and four thousand and four hundred
And the name of the daughter of Asher was Sarah
These are the families of the sons of Asher according to those that were numbered of them; who were fifty and three thousand and four hundred
These are the families of Naphtali according to their families: and they that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and four hundred
These were the numbered of the children of Israel, six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names
Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit
According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between many and few
And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt: and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister
And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar
And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before the LORD
And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel
These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho
But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai
And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying
Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons
Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son
Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father
And Moses brought their cause before the LORD
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter
And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren
And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren
And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel
And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered
And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying
Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation
which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd
And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him
and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight
And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient
And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation
And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation
and he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season
And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering
The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even
and a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil
It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD
And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD
And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof
this is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering
And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot
and three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram
And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering
And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the LORD
And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten
In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work therein
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish
and their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram
a several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs
and one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you
Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering

but ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year
and their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram
a several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs
and one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you
And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you
And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year without blemish
and their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram
and one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you
beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering, and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD
And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall not do any work therein
but ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish
and their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals to a bullock, and two tenth deals to one ram
a several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs
one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the sin offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and the meat offering of it, and their drink offerings

and ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be without blemish

And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without spot

and one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering
And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish

On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do no servile work therein
but ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: one bullock, one ram, seven lambs of the first year without blemish
their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner
and one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering
These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts, beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink offerings, and for your peace offerings
And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses
And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded
If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth
If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth
and her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand
And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul
and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her
But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her
And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath
and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her
Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void
But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them
But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity
These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people
And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian
Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war
So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war
And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand
And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males
And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword
And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods
And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire
And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts
And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho
And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp
And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle
And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive
Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD
Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him
But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves
And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood
And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses
only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead
every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water
And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation
and divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation
and levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep
take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD
And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD
And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses
And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep
and threescore and twelve thousand beeves
and threescore and one thousand asses
and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him
and the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen
And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and twelve
And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and one
And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was thirty and two persons
And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses
And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred
(now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep
and thirty and six thousand beeves
and thirty thousand asses and five hundred
and sixteen thousand persons;)
even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses
And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses
and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us
We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD
And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels
And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels
And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD
Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying
Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon
even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle
wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan
And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here
And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them
Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land
For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them
And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying
Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me
save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD
And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed
And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel
For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people
And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones
We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance
For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward
And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war
and will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him
and the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD
But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out
Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth
And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth
Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead
but thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith
So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel
and Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession
but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan
And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do
We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be our's
And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about
And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer
and Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah
and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fenced cities: and folds for sheep
And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim
and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded
And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it
And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein
And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havoth-jair
And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name
These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron
And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians
For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments
And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth
And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness
And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pi-hahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon: and they pitched before Migdol
And they departed from before Pi-hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah
And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they pitched there
And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea
And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin
And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah
And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush
And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink
And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai
And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at Kibroth-hattaavah
And they departed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and encamped at Hazeroth
And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah
And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmon-parez
And they departed from Rimmon-parez, and pitched in Libnah
And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah
And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah
And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher
And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah
And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth
And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath
And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah
And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah
And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah
And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth
And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Bene-jaakan
And they removed from Bene-jaakan, and encamped at Hor-hagidgad
And they went from Hor-hagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah
And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah
And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Ezion-geber
And they removed from Ezion-geber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh
And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom
And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month
And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor
And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel
And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah
And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon
And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth
And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ije-abarim, in the border of Moab
And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibon-gad
And they removed from Dibon-gad, and encamped in Almon-diblathaim
And they removed from Almon-diblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo
And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho
And they pitched by Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places
and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it
But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell
Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon
and the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea
And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border
And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor
from mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad
and the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your north border
And ye shall point out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham
and the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward
And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe
for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance
the two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun
And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance
These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying
Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them
And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts
And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about
And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities
So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs
And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan
then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares
And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment
And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge
Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge
These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither
And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death
And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death
Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death
The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him
But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die
But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait
or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm
and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil
But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled
and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession
So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings
Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die
Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death
And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest
So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it
Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel
And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel
and they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters
And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance
And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers
And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well
This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry
So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers
And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers
Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance
Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad
for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons
and they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father
These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho
The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel
To receive the instruction of wisdom,
Justice, and judgment, and equity
To give subtilty to the simple,
To the young man knowledge and discretion
A wise man will hear, and will increase learning;
And a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels
To understand a proverb, and the interpretation;
The words of the wise, and their dark sayings
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge:
But fools despise wisdom and instruction
My son, hear the instruction of thy father,
And forsake not the law of thy mother
For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head,
And chains about thy neck
My son, if sinners entice thee,
Consent thou not
If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood,
Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause
Let us swallow them up alive as the grave;
And whole, as those that go down into the pit
We shall find all precious substance,
We shall fill our houses with spoil
Cast in thy lot among us;
Let us all have one purse
My son, walk not thou in the way with them;
Refrain thy foot from their path
For their feet run to evil,
And make haste to shed blood
Surely in vain the net is spread
In the sight of any bird
And they lay wait for their own blood;
They lurk privily for their own lives
So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain;
Which taketh away the life of the owners thereof
Wisdom crieth without;
She uttereth her voice in the streets
She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates:
In the city she uttereth her words, saying
Turn you at my reproof:
Behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you,
I will make known my words unto you
Because I have called, and ye refused;
I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded
But ye have set at nought all my counsel,
And would none of my reproof
I also will laugh at your calamity;
I will mock when your fear cometh
When your fear cometh as desolation,
And your destruction cometh as a whirlwind;
When distress and anguish cometh upon you
For that they hated knowledge,
And did not choose the fear of the LORD
They would none of my counsel:
They despised all my reproof
Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,
And be filled with their own devices
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them,
And the prosperity of fools shall destroy them
But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely,
And shall be quiet from fear of evil
My son, if thou wilt receive my words,
And hide my commandments with thee
So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom,
And apply thine heart to understanding
Yea, if thou criest after knowledge,
And liftest up thy voice for understanding
If thou seekest her as silver,
And searchest for her as for hid treasures
Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD,
And find the knowledge of God
For the LORD giveth wisdom:
Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding
He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous:
He is a buckler to them that walk uprightly
He keepeth the paths of judgment,
And preserveth the way of his saints
Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment,
And equity; yea, every good path
When wisdom entereth into thine heart,
And knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul
Discretion shall preserve thee,
Understanding shall keep thee
To deliver thee from the way of the evil man,
From the man that speaketh froward things
Who leave the paths of uprightness,
To walk in the ways of darkness
Who rejoice to do evil,
And delight in the frowardness of the wicked
Whose ways are crooked,
And they froward in their paths
To deliver thee from the strange woman,
Even from the stranger which flattereth with her words
Which forsaketh the guide of her youth,
And forgetteth the covenant of her God
For her house inclineth unto death,
And her paths unto the dead
None that go unto her return again,
Neither take they hold of the paths of life
That thou mayest walk in the way of good men,
And keep the paths of the righteous
For the upright shall dwell in the land,
And the perfect shall remain in it
But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth,
And the transgressors shall be rooted out of it
My son, forget not my law;
But let thine heart keep my commandments
For length of days, and long life,
And peace, shall they add to thee
So shalt thou find favour and good understanding
In the sight of God and man
Trust in the LORD with all thine heart;
And lean not unto thine own understanding
In all thy ways acknowledge him,
And he shall direct thy paths
Be not wise in thine own eyes:
Fear the LORD, and depart from evil
It shall be health to thy navel,
And marrow to thy bones
Honour the LORD with thy substance,
And with the firstfruits of all thine increase
So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,
And thy presses shall burst out with new wine
My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD;
Neither be weary of his correction
For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth;
Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth
Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,
And the man that getteth understanding
For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver,
And the gain thereof than fine gold
She is more precious than rubies:
And all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her
Length of days is in her right hand;
And in her left hand riches and honour
Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
And all her paths are peace
The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth;
By understanding hath he established the heavens
By his knowledge the depths are broken up,
And the clouds drop down the dew
So shall they be life unto thy soul,
And grace to thy neck
Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely,
And thy foot shall not stumble
When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid:
Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet
Be not afraid of sudden fear,
Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh
For the LORD shall be thy confidence,
And shall keep thy foot from being taken
Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again,
And to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee
Devise not evil against thy neighbour,
Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee
Strive not with a man without cause,
If he have done thee no harm
Envy thou not the oppressor,
And choose none of his ways
For the froward is abomination to the LORD:
But his secret is with the righteous
The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked:
But he blesseth the habitation of the just
Surely he scorneth the scorners:
But he giveth grace unto the lowly
The wise shall inherit glory:
But shame shall be the promotion of fools
Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father,
And attend to know understanding
For I give you good doctrine,
Forsake ye not my law
For I was my father's son,
Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother
He taught me also, and said unto me,
Let thine heart retain my words:
Keep my commandments, and live
Get wisdom, get understanding:
Forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth
Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee:
Love her, and she shall keep thee
Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom:
And with all thy getting get understanding
Exalt her, and she shall promote thee:
She shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her
She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace:
A crown of glory shall she deliver to thee
Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings;
And the years of thy life shall be many
When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened;
And when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble
Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go:
Keep her; for she is thy life
Enter not into the path of the wicked,
And go not in the way of evil men
Avoid it, pass not by it,
Turn from it, and pass away
For they eat the bread of wickedness,
And drink the wine of violence
The way of the wicked is as darkness:
They know not at what they stumble
My son, attend to my words;
Incline thine ear unto my sayings
Let them not depart from thine eyes;
Keep them in the midst of thine heart
For they are life unto those that find them,
And health to all their flesh
Keep thy heart with all diligence;
For out of it are the issues of life
Put away from thee a froward mouth,
And perverse lips put far from thee
Let thine eyes look right on,
And let thine eyelids look straight before thee
Ponder the path of thy feet,
And let all thy ways be established
Remove thy foot from evil
My son, attend unto my wisdom,
And bow thine ear to my understanding
That thou mayest regard discretion,
And that thy lips may keep knowledge
For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb,
And her mouth is smoother than oil
But her end is bitter as wormwood,
Sharp as a twoedged sword
Her feet go down to death;
Her steps take hold on hell
Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life,
Her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them
Hear me now therefore, O ye children,
And depart not from the words of my mouth
Remove thy way far from her,
And come not nigh the door of her house
Lest thou give thine honour unto others,
And thy years unto the cruel
Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth;
And thy labours be in the house of a stranger
And thou mourn at the last,
When thy flesh and thy body are consumed
And say, How have I hated instruction,
And my heart despised reproof
And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers,
Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me
I was almost in all evil
In the midst of the congregation and assembly
Drink waters out of thine own cistern,
And running waters out of thine own well
Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad,
And rivers of waters in the streets
Let them be only thine own,
And not strangers' with thee
Let thy fountain be blessed:
And rejoice with the wife of thy youth
Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe;
Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times;
And be thou ravished always with her love
And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
And embrace the bosom of a stranger
For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD,
And he pondereth all his goings
His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself,
And he shall be holden with the cords of his sins
He shall die without instruction;
And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray
My son, if thou be surety for thy friend,
If thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger
Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth,
Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth
Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself,
When thou art come into the hand of thy friend;
Go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend
Give not sleep to thine eyes,
Nor slumber to thine eyelids
Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter,
And as a bird from the hand of the fowler
Go to the ant, thou sluggard;
Consider her ways, and be wise
Which having no guide,
Overseer, or ruler
Provideth her meat in the summer,
And gathereth her food in the harvest
How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard
When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
A little folding of the hands to sleep
So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth,
And thy want as an armed man
A naughty person, a wicked man,
Walketh with a froward mouth
He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet,
He teacheth with his fingers
Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually;
He soweth discord
Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly;
Suddenly shall he be broken without remedy
These six things doth the LORD hate:
Yea, seven are an abomination unto him
An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations,
Feet that be swift in running to mischief
A false witness that speaketh lies,
And he that soweth discord among brethren
My son, keep thy father's commandment,
And forsake not the law of thy mother
Bind them continually upon thine heart,
And tie them about thy neck
When thou goest, it shall lead thee;
When thou sleepest, it shall keep thee;
And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee
To keep thee from the evil woman,
From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman
Lust not after her beauty in thine heart;
Neither let her take thee with her eyelids
For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread:
And the adulteress will hunt for the precious life
Can a man take fire in his bosom,
And his clothes not be burned
Can one go upon hot coals,
And his feet not be burned
So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife;
Whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent
Men do not despise a thief, if he steal
To satisfy his soul when he is hungry
But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold;
He shall give all the substance of his house
But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding:
He that doeth it destroyeth his own soul
A wound and dishonour shall he get;
And his reproach shall not be wiped away
For jealousy is the rage of a man:
Therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance
He will not regard any ransom;
Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts
Keep my commandments, and live;
And my law as the apple of thine eye
Bind them upon thy fingers,
Write them upon the table of thine heart
That they may keep thee from the strange woman,
From the stranger which flattereth with her words
For at the window of my house
I looked through my casement
Passing through the street near her corner;
And he went the way to her house
In the twilight, in the evening,
In the black and dark night
And, behold, there met him a woman
With the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart
(She is loud and stubborn;
Her feet abide not in her house
So she caught him, and kissed him,
And with an impudent face said unto him
I have peace offerings with me;
This day have I payed my vows
Therefore came I forth to meet thee,
Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry,
With carved works, with fine linen of Egypt
I have perfumed my bed
With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning:
Let us solace ourselves with loves
For the goodman is not at home,
He is gone a long journey
He hath taken a bag of money with him,
And will come home at the day appointed
With her much fair speech she caused him to yield,
With the flattering of her lips she forced him
Till a dart strike through his liver;
As a bird hasteth to the snare,
And knoweth not that it is for his life
Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children,
And attend to the words of my mouth
Let not thine heart decline to her ways,
Go not astray in her paths
For she hath cast down many wounded:
Yea, many strong men have been slain by her
Her house is the way to hell,
Going down to the chambers of death
Doth not wisdom cry
And understanding put forth her voice
She standeth in the top of high places, by the way
In the places of the paths
She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city,
At the coming in at the doors
Unto you, O men, I call;
And my voice is to the sons of man
O ye simple, understand wisdom:
And, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart
Hear; for I will speak of excellent things;
And the opening of my lips shall be right things
For my mouth shall speak truth;
And wickedness is an abomination to my lips
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness;
There is nothing froward or perverse in them
They are all plain to him that understandeth,
And right to them that find knowledge
Receive my instruction, and not silver;
And knowledge rather than choice gold
For wisdom is better than rubies;
And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it
I wisdom dwell with prudence,
And find out knowledge of witty inventions
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom:
I am understanding; I have strength
By me kings reign,
And princes decree justice
By me princes rule,
And nobles, even all the judges of the earth
I love them that love me;
And those that seek me early shall find me
Riches and honour are with me;
Yea, durable riches and righteousness
My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold;
And my revenue than choice silver
I lead in the way of righteousness,
In the midst of the paths of judgment
That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance;
And I will fill their treasures
The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way,
Before his works of old
I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
Or ever the earth was
When there were no depths, I was brought forth;
When there were no fountains abounding with water
Before the mountains were settled,
Before the hills was I brought forth
While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
Nor the highest part of the dust of the world
When he prepared the heavens, I was there:
When he set a compass upon the face of the depth
When he established the clouds above:
When he strengthened the fountains of the deep
Then I was by him, as one brought up with him:
And I was daily his delight,
Rejoicing always before him
Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth;
And my delights were with the sons of men
Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children:
For blessed are they that keep my ways
Hear instruction, and be wise,
And refuse it not
Blessed is the man that heareth me,
Watching daily at my gates,
Waiting at the posts of my doors
For whoso findeth me findeth life,
And shall obtain favour of the LORD
But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul:
All they that hate me love death
Wisdom hath builded her house,
She hath hewn out her seven pillars
She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine;
She hath also furnished her table
She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth
Upon the highest places of the city
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither:
As for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him
Come, eat of my bread,
And drink of the wine which I have mingled
Forsake the foolish, and live;
And go in the way of understanding
He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame:
And he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot
Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee:
Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom:
And the knowledge of the holy is understanding
For by me thy days shall be multiplied,
And the years of thy life shall be increased
If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself:
But if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it
A foolish woman is clamorous:
She is simple, and knoweth nothing
For she sitteth at the door of her house,
On a seat in the high places of the city
To call passengers
Who go right on their ways
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither:
And as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him
Stolen waters are sweet,
And bread eaten in secret is pleasant
But he knoweth not that the dead are there;
And that her guests are in the depths of hell
Treasures of wickedness profit nothing:
But righteousness delivereth from death
The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish:
But he casteth away the substance of the wicked
He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand:
But the hand of the diligent maketh rich
He that gathereth in summer is a wise son:
But he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame
Blessings are upon the head of the just:
But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked
The memory of the just is blessed:
But the name of the wicked shall rot
The wise in heart will receive commandments:
But a prating fool shall fall
He that walketh uprightly walketh surely:
But he that perverteth his ways shall be known
He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow:
But a prating fool shall fall
The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life:
But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked
Hatred stirreth up strifes:
But love covereth all sins
In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:
But a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding
Wise men lay up knowledge:
But the mouth of the foolish is near destruction
The rich man's wealth is his strong city:
The destruction of the poor is their poverty
The labour of the righteous tendeth to life:
The fruit of the wicked to sin
He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction:
But he that refuseth reproof erreth
He that hideth hatred with lying lips,
And he that uttereth a slander, is a fool
In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin:
But he that refraineth his lips is wise
The tongue of the just is as choice silver:
The heart of the wicked is little worth
The lips of the righteous feed many:
But fools die for want of wisdom
The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich,
And he addeth no sorrow with it
It is as sport to a fool to do mischief:
But a man of understanding hath wisdom
The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him:
But the desire of the righteous shall be granted
As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more:
But the righteous is an everlasting foundation
As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,
So is the sluggard to them that send him
The fear of the LORD prolongeth days:
But the years of the wicked shall be shortened
The hope of the righteous shall be gladness:
But the expectation of the wicked shall perish
The way of the LORD is strength to the upright:
But destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity
The righteous shall never be removed:
But the wicked shall not inhabit the earth
The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom:
But the froward tongue shall be cut out
The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable:
But the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness
A false balance is abomination to the LORD:
But a just weight is his delight
When pride cometh, then cometh shame:
But with the lowly is wisdom
The integrity of the upright shall guide them:
But the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them
Riches profit not in the day of wrath:
But righteousness delivereth from death
The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way:
But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness
The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them:
But transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness
When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish:
And the hope of unjust men perisheth
The righteous is delivered out of trouble,
And the wicked cometh in his stead
An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour:
But through knowledge shall the just be delivered
When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth:
And when the wicked perish, there is shouting
By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted:
But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked
He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour:
But a man of understanding holdeth his peace
A talebearer revealeth secrets:
But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter
Where no counsel is, the people fall:
But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety
He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it:
And he that hateth suretiship is sure
A gracious woman retaineth honour:
And strong men retain riches
The merciful man doeth good to his own soul:
But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh
The wicked worketh a deceitful work:
But to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward
As righteousness tendeth to life:
So he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death
They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD:
But such as are upright in their way are his delight
Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished:
But the seed of the righteous shall be delivered
As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout,
So is a fair woman which is without discretion
The desire of the righteous is only good:
But the expectation of the wicked is wrath
There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth;
And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty
The liberal soul shall be made fat:
And he that watereth shall be watered also himself
He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him:
But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it
He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour:
But he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him
He that trusteth in his riches shall fall:
But the righteous shall flourish as a branch
He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind:
And the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life;
And he that winneth souls is wise
Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth:
Much more the wicked and the sinner
Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge:
But he that hateth reproof is brutish
A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD:
But a man of wicked devices will he condemn
A man shall not be established by wickedness:
But the root of the righteous shall not be moved
A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband:
But she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones
The thoughts of the righteous are right:
But the counsels of the wicked are deceit
The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood:
But the mouth of the upright shall deliver them
The wicked are overthrown, and are not:
But the house of the righteous shall stand
A man shall be commended according to his wisdom:
But he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised
He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better
Than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread
A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast:
But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel
He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread:
But he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding
The wicked desireth the net of evil men:
But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit
The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips:
But the just shall come out of trouble
A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth:
And the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him
A fool's wrath is presently known:
But a prudent man covereth shame
He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness:
But a false witness deceit
There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword:
But the tongue of the wise is health
The lip of truth shall be established for ever:
But a lying tongue is but for a moment
Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil:
But to the counsellors of peace is joy
There shall no evil happen to the just:
But the wicked shall be filled with mischief
Lying lips are abomination to the LORD:
But they that deal truly are his delight
A prudent man concealeth knowledge:
But the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness
The hand of the diligent shall bear rule:
But the slothful shall be under tribute
Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop:
But a good word maketh it glad
The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour:
But the way of the wicked seduceth them
The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting:
But the substance of a diligent man is precious
In the way of righteousness is life;
And in the pathway thereof there is no death
A wise son heareth his father's instruction:
But a scorner heareth not rebuke
A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth:
But the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence
He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life:
But he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction
The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing:
But the soul of the diligent shall be made fat
A righteous man hateth lying:
But a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame
Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way:
But wickedness overthroweth the sinner
There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing:
There is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches
The ransom of a man's life are his riches:
But the poor heareth not rebuke
The light of the righteous rejoiceth:
But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out
Only by pride cometh contention:
But with the well advised is wisdom
Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished:
But he that gathereth by labour shall increase
Hope deferred maketh the heart sick:
But when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life
Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed:
But he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded
The law of the wise is a fountain of life,
To depart from the snares of death
Good understanding giveth favour:
But the way of transgressors is hard
Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge:
But a fool layeth open his folly
A wicked messenger falleth into mischief:
But a faithful ambassador is health
Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction:
But he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured
The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul:
But it is abomination to fools to depart from evil
He that walketh with wise men shall be wise:
But a companion of fools shall be destroyed
Evil pursueth sinners:
But to the righteous good shall be repaid
A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children:
And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just
Much food is in the tillage of the poor:
But there is that is destroyed for want of judgment
He that spareth his rod hateth his son:
But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes
The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul:
But the belly of the wicked shall want
Every wise woman buildeth her house:
But the foolish plucketh it down with her hands
He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD:
But he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him
In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride:
But the lips of the wise shall preserve them
Where no oxen are, the crib is clean:
But much increase is by the strength of the ox
A faithful witness will not lie:
But a false witness will utter lies
A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not:
But knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth
Go from the presence of a foolish man,
When thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge
The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way:
But the folly of fools is deceit
Fools make a mock at sin:
But among the righteous there is favour
The heart knoweth his own bitterness;
And a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy
The house of the wicked shall be overthrown:
But the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish
There is a way which seemeth right unto a man,
But the end thereof are the ways of death
Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful;
And the end of that mirth is heaviness
The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways:
And a good man shall be satisfied from himself
The simple believeth every word:
But the prudent man looketh well to his going
A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil:
But the fool rageth, and is confident
He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly:
And a man of wicked devices is hated
The simple inherit folly:
But the prudent are crowned with knowledge
The evil bow before the good;
And the wicked at the gates of the righteous
The poor is hated even of his own neighbour:
But the rich hath many friends
He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth:
But he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he
Do they not err that devise evil
But mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good
In all labour there is profit:
But the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury
The crown of the wise is their riches:
But the foolishness of fools is folly
A true witness delivereth souls:
But a deceitful witness speaketh lies
In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence:
And his children shall have a place of refuge
The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life,
To depart from the snares of death
In the multitude of people is the king's honour:
But in the want of people is the destruction of the prince
He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding:
But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly
A sound heart is the life of the flesh:
But envy the rottenness of the bones
He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker:
But he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor
The wicked is driven away in his wickedness:
But the righteous hath hope in his death
Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding:
But that which is in the midst of fools is made known
Righteousness exalteth a nation:
But sin is a reproach to any people
The king's favour is toward a wise servant:
But his wrath is against him that causeth shame
A soft answer turneth away wrath:
But grievous words stir up anger
The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright:
But the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness
The eyes of the LORD are in every place,
Beholding the evil and the good
A wholesome tongue is a tree of life:
But perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit
A fool despiseth his father's instruction:
But he that regardeth reproof is prudent
In the house of the righteous is much treasure:
But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble
The lips of the wise disperse knowledge:
But the heart of the foolish doeth not so
The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD:
But the prayer of the upright is his delight
The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:
But he loveth him that followeth after righteousness
Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way:
And he that hateth reproof shall die
Hell and destruction are before the LORD:
How much more then the hearts of the children of men
A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him:
Neither will he go unto the wise
A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance:
But by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken
The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:
But the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness
All the days of the afflicted are evil:
But he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast
Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,
Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith
A wrathful man stirreth up strife:
But he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife
The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns:
But the way of the righteous is made plain
A wise son maketh a glad father:
But a foolish man despiseth his mother
Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom:
But a man of understanding walketh uprightly
Without counsel purposes are disappointed:
But in the multitude of counsellors they are established
A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth:
And a word spoken in due season, how good is it
The way of life is above to the wise,
That he may depart from hell beneath
The LORD will destroy the house of the proud:
But he will establish the border of the widow
The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD:
But the words of the pure are pleasant words
He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house;
But he that hateth gifts shall live
The heart of the righteous studieth to answer:
But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things
The LORD is far from the wicked:
But he heareth the prayer of the righteous
The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart:
And a good report maketh the bones fat
The ear that heareth the reproof of life
Abideth among the wise
He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul:
But he that heareth reproof getteth understanding
The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom;
And before honour is humility
The preparations of the heart in man,
And the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD
All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes;
But the LORD weigheth the spirits
Commit thy works unto the LORD,
And thy thoughts shall be established
The LORD hath made all things for himself:
Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil
Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD:
Though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished
By mercy and truth iniquity is purged:
And by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil
When a man's ways please the LORD,
He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him
Better is a little with righteousness
Than great revenues without right
A man's heart deviseth his way:
But the LORD directeth his steps
A divine sentence is in the lips of the king:
His mouth transgresseth not in judgment
A just weight and balance are the LORD's:
All the weights of the bag are his work
It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness:
For the throne is established by righteousness
Righteous lips are the delight of kings;
And they love him that speaketh right
The wrath of a king is as messengers of death:
But a wise man will pacify it
In the light of the king's countenance is life;
And his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain
How much better is it to get wisdom than gold
And to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver
The highway of the upright is to depart from evil:
He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul
Pride goeth before destruction,
And an haughty spirit before a fall
Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly,
Than to divide the spoil with the proud
He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good:
And whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he
The wise in heart shall be called prudent:
And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning
Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it:
But the instruction of fools is folly
The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth,
And addeth learning to his lips
Pleasant words are as an honeycomb,
Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones
There is a way that seemeth right unto a man,
But the end thereof are the ways of death
He that laboureth laboureth for himself;
For his mouth craveth it of him
An ungodly man diggeth up evil:
And in his lips there is as a burning fire
A froward man soweth strife:
And a whisperer separateth chief friends
A violent man enticeth his neighbour,
And leadeth him into the way that is not good
He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things:
Moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass
The hoary head is a crown of glory,
If it be found in the way of righteousness
The lot is cast into the lap;
But the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD
Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith,
Than an house full of sacrifices with strife
A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,
And shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren
The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold:
But the LORD trieth the hearts
A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips;
And a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue
Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker:
And he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished
Children's children are the crown of old men;
And the glory of children are their fathers
Excellent speech becometh not a fool:
Much less do lying lips a prince
A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth
He that covereth a transgression seeketh love;
But he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends
A reproof entereth more into a wise man
Than an hundred stripes into a fool
An evil man seeketh only rebellion:
Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him
Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
Rather than a fool in his folly
Whoso rewardeth evil for good,
Evil shall not depart from his house
The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:
Therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with
Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom,
Seeing he hath no heart to it
A friend loveth at all times,
And a brother is born for adversity
A man void of understanding striketh hands,
And becometh surety in the presence of his friend
He loveth transgression that loveth strife:
And he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction
He that hath a froward heart findeth no good:
And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief
He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow:
And the father of a fool hath no joy
A merry heart doeth good like a medicine:
But a broken spirit drieth the bones
A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom
To pervert the ways of judgment
Wisdom is before him that hath understanding;
But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth
A foolish son is a grief to his father,
And bitterness to her that bare him
Also to punish the just is not good,
Nor to strike princes for equity
He that hath knowledge spareth his words:
And a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit
Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise:
And he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding
Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh
And intermeddleth with all wisdom
A fool hath no delight in understanding,
But that his heart may discover itself
When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt,
And with ignominy reproach
The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters,
And the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook
It is not good to accept the person of the wicked,
To overthrow the righteous in judgment
A fool's lips enter into contention,
And his mouth calleth for strokes
A fool's mouth is his destruction,
And his lips are the snare of his soul
The words of a talebearer are as wounds,
And they go down into the innermost parts of the belly
He also that is slothful in his work
Is brother to him that is a great waster
The name of the LORD is a strong tower:
The righteous runneth into it, and is safe
The rich man's wealth is his strong city,
And as an high wall in his own conceit
Before destruction the heart of man is haughty,
And before honour is humility
He that answereth a matter before he heareth it,
It is folly and shame unto him
The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;
But a wounded spirit who can bear
The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge;
And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge
A man's gift maketh room for him,
And bringeth him before great men
He that is first in his own cause seemeth just;
But his neighbour cometh and searcheth him
The lot causeth contentions to cease,
And parteth between the mighty
A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city:
And their contentions are like the bars of a castle
A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;
And with the increase of his lips shall he be filled
Death and life are in the power of the tongue:
And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof
Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing,
And obtaineth favour of the LORD
The poor useth intreaties;
But the rich answereth roughly
A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly:
And there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother
Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity,
Than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool
Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good;
And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth
The foolishness of man perverteth his way:
And his heart fretteth against the LORD
Wealth maketh many friends;
But the poor is separated from his neighbour
A false witness shall not be unpunished,
And he that speaketh lies shall not escape
Many will intreat the favour of the prince:
And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts
All the brethren of the poor do hate him:
How much more do his friends go far from him
He pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him
He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul:
He that keepeth understanding shall find good
A false witness shall not be unpunished,
And he that speaketh lies shall perish
Delight is not seemly for a fool;
Much less for a servant to have rule over princes
The discretion of a man deferreth his anger;
And it is his glory to pass over a transgression
The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion;
But his favour is as dew upon the grass
A foolish son is the calamity of his father:
And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping
House and riches are the inheritance of fathers:
And a prudent wife is from the LORD
Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep;
And an idle soul shall suffer hunger
He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul;
But he that despiseth his ways shall die
He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD;
And that which he hath given will he pay him again
Chasten thy son while there is hope,
And let not thy soul spare for his crying
Hear counsel, and receive instruction,
That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end
There are many devices in a man's heart;
Nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand
The desire of a man is his kindness:
And a poor man is better than a liar
A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom,
And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again
Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware:
And reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge
He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother,
Is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach
Cease, my son, to hear the instruction
That causeth to err from the words of knowledge
An ungodly witness scorneth judgment:
And the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity
Judgments are prepared for scorners,
And stripes for the back of fools
The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion:
Whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul
It is an honour for a man to cease from strife:
But every fool will be meddling
The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold;
Therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing
Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water;
But a man of understanding will draw it out
Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness:
But a faithful man who can find
The just man walketh in his integrity:
His children are blessed after him
A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment
Scattereth away all evil with his eyes
Who can say, I have made my heart clean,
I am pure from my sin
Even a child is known by his doings,
Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right
The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,
The LORD hath made even both of them
Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty;
Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread
It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer:
But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth
There is gold, and a multitude of rubies:
But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger:
And take a pledge of him for a strange woman
Bread of deceit is sweet to a man;
But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel
Every purpose is established by counsel:
And with good advice make war
He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets:
Therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips
Whoso curseth his father or his mother,
His lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness
An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning;
But the end thereof shall not be blessed
Say not thou, I will recompense evil;
But wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee
Man's goings are of the LORD;
How can a man then understand his own way
It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy,
And after vows to make enquiry
A wise king scattereth the wicked,
And bringeth the wheel over them
The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD,
Searching all the inward parts of the belly
Mercy and truth preserve the king:
And his throne is upholden by mercy
The glory of young men is their strength:
And the beauty of old men is the grey head
The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil:
So do stripes the inward parts of the belly
The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD,
As the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will
Every way of a man is right in his own eyes:
But the LORD pondereth the hearts
To do justice and judgment
Is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice
An high look, and a proud heart,
And the plowing of the wicked, is sin
The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness;
But of every one that is hasty only to want
The getting of treasures by a lying tongue
Is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death
The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them;
Because they refuse to do judgment
The way of man is froward and strange:
But as for the pure, his work is right
It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop,
Than with a brawling woman in a wide house
The soul of the wicked desireth evil:
His neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes
The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked:
But God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness
Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor,
He also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard
A gift in secret pacifieth anger:
And a reward in the bosom strong wrath
It is joy to the just to do judgment:
But destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity
The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding
Shall remain in the congregation of the dead
He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man:
He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich
The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous,
And the transgressor for the upright
It is better to dwell in the wilderness,
Than with a contentious and an angry woman
There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
But a foolish man spendeth it up
He that followeth after righteousness and mercy
Findeth life, righteousness, and honour
A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty,
And casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof
Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue
Keepeth his soul from troubles
Proud and haughty scorner is his name,
Who dealeth in proud wrath
The desire of the slothful killeth him;
For his hands refuse to labour
He coveteth greedily all the day long:
But the righteous giveth and spareth not
The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination:
How much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind
A false witness shall perish:
But the man that heareth speaketh constantly
A wicked man hardeneth his face:
But as for the upright, he directeth his way
The horse is prepared against the day of battle:
But safety is of the LORD
A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches,
And loving favour rather than silver and gold
The rich and poor meet together:
The LORD is the maker of them all
A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself:
But the simple pass on, and are punished
By humility and the fear of the LORD
Are riches, and honour, and life
Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward:
He that doth keep his soul shall be far from them
Train up a child in the way he should go:
And when he is old, he will not depart from it
The rich ruleth over the poor,
And the borrower is servant to the lender
He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity:
And the rod of his anger shall fail
He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed;
For he giveth of his bread to the poor
Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out;
Yea, strife and reproach shall cease
He that loveth pureness of heart,
For the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend
The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge,
And he overthroweth the words of the transgressor
The slothful man saith, There is a lion without,
I shall be slain in the streets
The mouth of strange women is a deep pit:
He that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein
Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child;
But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him
He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches,
And he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want
Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise,
And apply thine heart unto my knowledge
For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee;
They shall withal be fitted in thy lips
That thy trust may be in the LORD,
I have made known to thee this day, even to thee
Have not I written to thee excellent things
In counsels and knowledge
That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth;
That thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee
For the LORD will plead their cause,
And spoil the soul of those that spoiled them
Make no friendship with an angry man;
And with a furious man thou shalt not go
Lest thou learn his ways,
And get a snare to thy soul
Be not thou one of them that strike hands,
Or of them that are sureties for debts
If thou hast nothing to pay,
Why should he take away thy bed from under thee
Remove not the ancient landmark,
Which thy fathers have set
Seest thou a man diligent in his business
he shall stand before kings;
He shall not stand before mean men
When thou sittest to eat with a ruler,
Consider diligently what is before thee
Be not desirous of his dainties:
For they are deceitful meat
Labour not to be rich:
Cease from thine own wisdom
Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not
For riches certainly make themselves wings;
They fly away as an eagle toward heaven
Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye,
Neither desire thou his dainty meats
For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he:
Eat and drink, saith he to thee;
But his heart is not with thee
The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up,
And lose thy sweet words
Speak not in the ears of a fool:
For he will despise the wisdom of thy words
Remove not the old landmark;
And enter not into the fields of the fatherless
For their redeemer is mighty;
He shall plead their cause with thee
Apply thine heart unto instruction,
And thine ears to the words of knowledge
Withhold not correction from the child:
For if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die
Thou shalt beat him with the rod,
And shalt deliver his soul from hell
My son, if thine heart be wise,
My heart shall rejoice, even mine
Yea, my reins shall rejoice,
When thy lips speak right things
Let not thine heart envy sinners:
But be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long
For surely there is an end;
And thine expectation shall not be cut off
Be not among winebibbers;
Among riotous eaters of flesh
For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty:
And drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags
Hearken unto thy father that begat thee,
And despise not thy mother when she is old
Buy the truth, and sell it not;
Also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding
The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice:
And he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him
Thy father and thy mother shall be glad,
And she that bare thee shall rejoice
My son, give me thine heart,
And let thine eyes observe my ways
For a whore is a deep ditch;
And a strange woman is a narrow pit
She also lieth in wait as for a prey,
And increaseth the transgressors among men
They that tarry long at the wine;
They that go to seek mixed wine
Thine eyes shall behold strange women,
And thine heart shall utter perverse things
Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea,
Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast
Be not thou envious against evil men,
Neither desire to be with them
For their heart studieth destruction,
And their lips talk of mischief
Through wisdom is an house builded;
And by understanding it is established
A wise man is strong;
Yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength
For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war:
And in multitude of counsellors there is safety
Wisdom is too high for a fool:
He openeth not his mouth in the gate
He that deviseth to do evil
Shall be called a mischievous person
The thought of foolishness is sin:
And the scorner is an abomination to men
If thou faint in the day of adversity,
Thy strength is small
If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death,
And those that are ready to be slain
If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not;
Doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it
And he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it
And shall not he render to every man according to his works
My son, eat thou honey, because it is good;
And the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste
So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul:
When thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward,
And thy expectation shall not be cut off
Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;
Spoil not his resting place
For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again:
But the wicked shall fall into mischief
Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,
And let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth
Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him,
And he turn away his wrath from him
Fret not thyself because of evil men,
Neither be thou envious at the wicked
For there shall be no reward to the evil man;
The candle of the wicked shall be put out
My son, fear thou the LORD and the king:
And meddle not with them that are given to change
For their calamity shall rise suddenly;
And who knoweth the ruin of them both
These things also belong to the wise
It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment
He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous;
Him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him
But to them that rebuke him shall be delight,
And a good blessing shall come upon them
Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause;
And deceive not with thy lips
Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me:
I will render to the man according to his work
I went by the field of the slothful,
And by the vineyard of the man void of understanding
Then I saw, and considered it well:
I looked upon it, and received instruction
A little folding of the hands to sleep
So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth;
And thy want as an armed man
These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out
It is the glory of God to conceal a thing:
But the honour of kings is to search out a matter
Take away the dross from the silver,
And there shall come forth a vessel for the finer
Take away the wicked from before the king,
And his throne shall be established in righteousness
Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king,
And stand not in the place of great men
Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself;
And discover not a secret to another
Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame,
And thine infamy turn not away
A word fitly spoken
Is like apples of gold in pictures of silver
As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,
So is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear
As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
So is a faithful messenger to them that send him:
For he refresheth the soul of his masters
Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift
Is like clouds and wind without rain
By long forbearing is a prince persuaded,
And a soft tongue breaketh the bone
Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house;
Lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee
A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour
Is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow
Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble
Is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint
If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat;
And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink
For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,
And the LORD shall reward thee
The north wind driveth away rain:
So doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue
As cold waters to a thirsty soul,
So is good news from a far country
A righteous man falling down before the wicked
Is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring
It is not good to eat much honey:
So for men to search their own glory is not glory
He that hath no rule over his own spirit
Is like a city that is broken down, and without walls
As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,
So honour is not seemly for a fool
A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass,
And a rod for the fool's back
Answer not a fool according to his folly,
Lest thou also be like unto him
Answer a fool according to his folly,
Lest he be wise in his own conceit
He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool
Cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage
The legs of the lame are not equal:
So is a parable in the mouth of fools
As he that bindeth a stone in a sling,
So is he that giveth honour to a fool
As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard,
So is a parable in the mouth of fools
The great God that formed all things
Both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors
As a dog returneth to his vomit,
So a fool returneth to his folly
Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit
There is more hope of a fool than of him
The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way;
A lion is in the streets
The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom;
It grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth
The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit
Than seven men that can render a reason
He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him,
Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears
As a mad man who casteth firebrands,
Arrows, and death
So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour,
And saith, Am not I in sport
The words of a talebearer are as wounds,
And they go down into the innermost parts of the belly
Burning lips and a wicked heart
Are like a potsherd covered with silver dross
He that hateth dissembleth with his lips,
And layeth up deceit within him
When he speaketh fair, believe him not:
For there are seven abominations in his heart
Whose hatred is covered by deceit,
His wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation
Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein:
And he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him
A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it;
And a flattering mouth worketh ruin
Boast not thyself of to morrow;
For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth
Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth;
A stranger, and not thine own lips
A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty;
But a fool's wrath is heavier than them both
Faithful are the wounds of a friend;
But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful
The full soul loatheth an honeycomb;
But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet
As a bird that wandereth from her nest,
So is a man that wandereth from his place
Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart:
So doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel
Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
Neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity:
For better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off
My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,
That I may answer him that reproacheth me
A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself;
But the simple pass on, and are punished
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger,
And take a pledge of him for a strange woman
He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning,
It shall be counted a curse to him
A continual dropping in a very rainy day
And a contentious woman are alike
Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind,
And the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself
Iron sharpeneth iron;
So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend
Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof:
So he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured
As in water face answereth to face,
So the heart of man to man
Hell and destruction are never full;
So the eyes of man are never satisfied
As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold;
So is a man to his praise
Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle,
Yet will not his foolishness depart from him
Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks,
And look well to thy herds
For riches are not for ever:
And doth the crown endure to every generation
The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself,
And herbs of the mountains are gathered
The lambs are for thy clothing,
And the goats are the price of the field
And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household,
And for the maintenance for thy maidens
The wicked flee when no man pursueth:
But the righteous are bold as a lion
For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof:
But by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged
A poor man that oppresseth the poor
Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food
They that forsake the law praise the wicked:
But such as keep the law contend with them
Evil men understand not judgment:
But they that seek the LORD understand all things
Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness,
Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich
Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son:
But he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father
He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance,
He shall gather it for him that will pity the poor
He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law,
Even his prayer shall be abomination
Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way,
He shall fall himself into his own pit:
But the upright shall have good things in possession
The rich man is wise in his own conceit;
But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out
When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory:
But when the wicked rise, a man is hidden
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper:
But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy
Happy is the man that feareth alway:
But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief
As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear;
So is a wicked ruler over the poor people
The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor:
But he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days
Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved:
But he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once
He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread:
But he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough
A faithful man shall abound with blessings:
But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent
To have respect of persons is not good:
For for a piece of bread that man will transgress
He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye,
And considereth not that poverty shall come upon him
He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife:
But he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool:
But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered
He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack:
But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse
When the wicked rise, men hide themselves:
But when they perish, the righteous increase
When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice:
But when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn
Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father:
But he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance
The king by judgment establisheth the land:
But he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it
A man that flattereth his neighbour
Spreadeth a net for his feet
In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare:
But the righteous doth sing and rejoice
The righteous considereth the cause of the poor:
But the wicked regardeth not to know it
Scornful men bring a city into a snare:
But wise men turn away wrath
If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man,
Whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest
The bloodthirsty hate the upright:
But the just seek his soul
A fool uttereth all his mind:
But a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards
If a ruler hearken to lies,
All his servants are wicked
The poor and the deceitful man meet together:
The LORD lighteneth both their eyes
The king that faithfully judgeth the poor,
His throne shall be established for ever
The rod and reproof give wisdom:
But a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame
When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth:
But the righteous shall see their fall
Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest;
Yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul
Where there is no vision, the people perish:
But he that keepeth the law, happy is he
A servant will not be corrected by words:
For though he understand he will not answer
Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words
There is more hope of a fool than of him
An angry man stirreth up strife,
And a furious man aboundeth in transgression
A man's pride shall bring him low:
But honour shall uphold the humble in spirit
Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul:
He heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not
The fear of man bringeth a snare:
But whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe
Many seek the ruler's favour;
But every man's judgment cometh from the LORD
An unjust man is an abomination to the just:
And he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked
Surely I am more brutish than any man,
And have not the understanding of a man
I neither learned wisdom,
Nor have the knowledge of the holy
Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended
Who hath gathered the wind in his fists
Who hath bound the waters in a garment
Who hath established all the ends of the earth
What is his name, and what is his son's name,
If thou canst tell
Every word of God is pure:
He is a shield unto them that put their trust in him
Add thou not unto his words,
Lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar
Two things have I required of thee;
Deny me them not before I die
Remove far from me vanity and lies:
Give me neither poverty nor riches;
Feed me with food convenient for me
Accuse not a servant unto his master,
Lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty
There is a generation that curseth their father,
And doth not bless their mother
There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes,
And yet is not washed from their filthiness
There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes
And their eyelids are lifted up
The eye that mocketh at his father,
And despiseth to obey his mother,
The ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
And the young eagles shall eat it
There be three things which are too wonderful for me,
Yea, four which I know not
The way of an eagle in the air;
The way of a serpent upon a rock;
The way of a ship in the midst of the sea;
And the way of a man with a maid
Such is the way of an adulterous woman;
She eateth, and wipeth her mouth,
And saith, I have done no wickedness
For three things the earth is disquieted,
And for four which it cannot bear
For a servant when he reigneth;
And a fool when he is filled with meat
For an odious woman when she is married;
And an handmaid that is heir to her mistress
There be four things which are little upon the earth,
But they are exceeding wise
The ants are a people not strong,
Yet they prepare their meat in the summer
The conies are but a feeble folk,
Yet make they their houses in the rocks
The locusts have no king,
Yet go they forth all of them by bands
The spider taketh hold with her hands,
And is in kings' palaces
There be three things which go well,
Yea, four are comely in going
A lion which is strongest among beasts,
And turneth not away for any
An greyhound; an he goat also;
And a king, against whom there is no rising up
If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself,
Or if thou hast thought evil,
Lay thine hand upon thy mouth
Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter,
And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood:
So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife
The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him
What, my son
and what, the son of my womb
And what, the son of my vows
Give not thy strength unto women,
Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine;
Nor for princes strong drink
Lest they drink, and forget the law,
And pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted
Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish,
And wine unto those that be of heavy hearts
Let him drink, and forget his poverty,
And remember his misery no more
Open thy mouth for the dumb
In the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction
Who can find a virtuous woman
For her price is far above rubies
The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her,
So that he shall have no need of spoil
She seeketh wool, and flax,
And worketh willingly with her hands
She is like the merchants' ships;
She bringeth her food from afar
She riseth also while it is yet night,
And giveth meat to her household,
And a portion to her maidens
She considereth a field, and buyeth it:
With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard
She girdeth her loins with strength,
And strengtheneth her arms
She perceiveth that her merchandise is good:
Her candle goeth not out by night
She layeth her hands to the spindle,
And her hands hold the distaff
She stretcheth out her hand to the poor;
Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy
She is not afraid of the snow for her household:
For all her household are clothed with scarlet
She maketh herself coverings of tapestry;
Her clothing is silk and purple
Her husband is known in the gates,
When he sitteth among the elders of the land
She maketh fine linen, and selleth it;
And delivereth girdles unto the merchant
Strength and honour are her clothing;
And she shall rejoice in time to come
She openeth her mouth with wisdom;
And in her tongue is the law of kindness
She looketh well to the ways of her household,
And eateth not the bread of idleness
Her children arise up, and call her blessed;
Her husband also, and he praiseth her
Many daughters have done virtuously,
But thou excellest them all
Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain:
But a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised
Give her of the fruit of her hands;
And let her own works praise her in the gates
But his delight is in the law of the LORD;
And in his law doth he meditate day and night
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
That bringeth forth his fruit in his season;
His leaf also shall not wither;
And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
The ungodly are not so:
But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,
Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous
For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous:
But the way of the ungodly shall perish
Why do the heathen rage,
And the people imagine a vain thing
Let us break their bands asunder,
And cast away their cords from us
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh:
The Lord shall have them in derision
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath,
And vex them in his sore displeasure
Serve the LORD with fear,
And rejoice with trembling
Many there be which say of my soul,
There is no help for him in God
I cried unto the LORD with my voice,
And he heard me out of his holy hill
I laid me down and slept;
I awaked; for the LORD sustained me
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people,
That have set themselves against me round about
But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself:
The LORD will hear when I call unto him
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,
And put your trust in the LORD
Thou hast put gladness in my heart,
More than in the time that their corn and their wine increased
Give ear to my words, O LORD,
Consider my meditation
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
Neither shall evil dwell with thee
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight:
Thou hatest all workers of iniquity
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth;
Their inward part is very wickedness;
Their throat is an open sepulchre;
They flatter with their tongue
For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous;
With favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak:
O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed
For in death there is no remembrance of thee:
In the grave who shall give thee thanks
I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim;
I water my couch with my tears
Mine eye is consumed because of grief;
It waxeth old because of all mine enemies
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity;
For the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping
The LORD hath heard my supplication;
The LORD will receive my prayer
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed:
Let them return and be ashamed suddenly
O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust:
Save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me
O LORD my God, if I have done this;
If there be iniquity in my hands
If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
(Yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:
For their sakes therefore return thou on high
Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end;
but establish the just:
For the righteous God
Trieth the hearts and reins
My defence is of God,
Which saveth the upright in heart
God judgeth the righteous,
And God is angry with the wicked every day
He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death;
Behold, he travaileth with iniquity,
And hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood
He made a pit, and digged it,
And is fallen into the ditch which he made
His mischief shall return upon his own head,
And his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate
I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness:
And will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,
The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained
What is man, that thou art mindful of him
And the son of man, that thou visitest him
For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,
And hast crowned him with glory and honour
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
Thou hast put all things under his feet
All sheep and oxen,
Yea, and the beasts of the field
The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea,
And whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas
O LORD our Lord,
How excellent is thy name in all the earth
When mine enemies are turned back,
They shall fall and perish at thy presence
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause;
Thou satest in the throne judging right
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
Thou hast put out their name for ever and ever
But the LORD shall endure for ever:
He hath prepared his throne for judgment
And he shall judge the world in righteousness,
He shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness
The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed,
A refuge in times of trouble
And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee:
For thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee
When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them:
He forgetteth not the cry of the humble
The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth:
The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands
The wicked shall be turned into hell,
And all the nations that forget God
For the needy shall not alway be forgotten:
The expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever
Put them in fear, O LORD:
That the nations may know themselves to be but men
Why standest thou afar off, O LORD
Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble
The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor:
Let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined
For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire,
And blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth
The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God:
God is not in all his thoughts
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud:
Under his tongue is mischief and vanity
He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages:
In the secret places doth he murder the innocent: His eyes are privily set against the poor
He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den:
He lieth in wait to catch the poor:
He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net
Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God
He hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it
Break thou the arm of the wicked
And the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none
The LORD is King for ever and ever:
The heathen are perished out of his land
LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble:
Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear
To judge the fatherless and the oppressed,
That the man of the earth may no more oppress
For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string,
That they may privily shoot at the upright in heart
The LORD trieth the righteous:
But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth
Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest:
This shall be the portion of their cup
They speak vanity every one with his neighbour:
With flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak
The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips,
And the tongue that speaketh proud things
For the oppression of the poor,
For the sighing of the needy,
Now will I arise, saith the LORD;
The words of the LORD are pure words:
As silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times
The wicked walk on every side,
When the vilest men are exalted
How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD
for ever
How long wilt thou hide thy face from me
But I have trusted in thy mercy;
My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation
I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me
There were they in great fear:
For God is in the generation of the righteous
Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor,
Because the LORD is his refuge
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion
When the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people,
Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad
LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle
Who shall dwell in thy holy hill
He that walketh uprightly,
and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart
He that putteth not out his money to usury,
Nor taketh reward against the innocent
He that doeth these things shall never be moved
But to the saints that are in the earth,
And to the excellent, in whom is all my delight
The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
Thou maintainest my lot
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places;
Yea, I have a goodly heritage
I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel:
My reins also instruct me in the night seasons
I have set the LORD always before me:
Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth:
My flesh also shall rest in hope
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;
Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence;
Let thine eyes behold the things that are equal
Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips
I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer
Keep me as the apple of the eye,
Hide me under the shadow of thy wings
From the wicked that oppress me,
From my deadly enemies, who compass me about
They are inclosed in their own fat:
With their mouth they speak proudly
They have now compassed us in our steps:
They have set their eyes bowing down to the earth
Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey,
And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places
Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down:
Deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword
From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
Which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure:
They are full of children,
And leave the rest of their substance to their babes
I will love thee, O LORD, my strength
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
My God, my strength, in whom I will trust;
My buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower
The sorrows of death compassed me,
And the floods of ungodly men made me afraid
The sorrows of hell compassed me about:
The snares of death prevented me
In my distress I called upon the LORD,
And cried unto my God:
He heard my voice out of his temple,
And my cry came before him, even into his ears
Then the earth shook and trembled;
The foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth
He bowed the heavens also, and came down:
And darkness was under his feet
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly:
Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind
He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him
Were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies
Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them;
And he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them
Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD,
At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils
He sent from above, he took me,
He drew me out of many waters
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me:
For they were too strong for me
He brought me forth also into a large place;
He delivered me, because he delighted in me
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness;
According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me
For I have kept the ways of the LORD,
And have not wickedly departed from my God
For all his judgments were before me,
And I did not put away his statutes from me
I was also upright before him,
And I kept myself from mine iniquity
Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness,
According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful;
With an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure;
And with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward
For thou wilt save the afflicted people;
But wilt bring down high looks
For by thee I have run through a troop;
And by my God have I leaped over a wall
It is God that girdeth me with strength,
And maketh my way perfect
He maketh my feet like hinds' feet,
And setteth me upon my high places
He teacheth my hands to war,
So that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,
That my feet did not slip
I have wounded them that they were not able to rise:
They are fallen under my feet
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies;
That I might destroy them that hate me
They cried, but there was none to save them:
Even unto the LORD, but he answered them not
Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind:
I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me:
The strangers shall submit themselves unto me
The strangers shall fade away,
And be afraid out of their close places
It is God that avengeth me,
And subdueth the people under me
Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen,
And sing praises unto thy name
The heavens declare the glory of God;
And the firmament sheweth his handywork
Day unto day uttereth speech,
And night unto night sheweth knowledge
His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it:
And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof
The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul:
The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple
The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever:
The judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb
Moreover by them is thy servant warned:
And in keeping of them there is great reward
Who can understand his errors
Cleanse thou me from secret faults
The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble;
The name of the God of Jacob defend thee
Send thee help from the sanctuary,
And strengthen thee out of Zion
Grant thee according to thine own heart,
And fulfil all thy counsel
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses:
But we will remember the name of the LORD our God
They are brought down and fallen:
But we are risen, and stand upright
Let the king hear us when we call
The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD;
And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice
For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness:
Thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head
Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies:
Thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee
Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth,
And their seed from among the children of men
For they intended evil against thee:
They imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform
Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back,
When thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them
Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength:
So will we sing and praise thy power
Our fathers trusted in thee:
They trusted, and thou didst deliver them
They cried unto thee, and were delivered:
They trusted in thee, and were not confounded
All they that see me laugh me to scorn:
They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying
But thou art he that took me out of the womb:
Thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts
I was cast upon thee from the womb:
Thou art my God from my mother's belly
Many bulls have compassed me:
Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws;
And thou hast brought me into the dust of death
For dogs have compassed me:
The assembly of the wicked have inclosed me:
They pierced my hands and my feet
I may tell all my bones:
They look and stare upon me
They part my garments among them,
And cast lots upon my vesture
Deliver my soul from the sword;
My darling from the power of the dog
Save me from the lion's mouth:
For thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns
I will declare thy name unto my brethren:
In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee
My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation:
I will pay my vows before them that fear him
All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD:
And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee
All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship:
All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him:
And none can keep alive his own soul
A seed shall serve him;
It shall be accounted to the LORD for a generation
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
He leadeth me beside the still waters
For he hath founded it upon the seas,
And established it upon the floods
Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD
Or who shall stand in his holy place
He shall receive the blessing from the LORD,
And righteousness from the God of his salvation
This is the generation of them that seek him,
That seek thy face, O Jacob
Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul
Shew me thy ways, O LORD;
Teach me thy paths
Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
For they have been ever of old
Good and upright is the LORD:
Therefore will he teach sinners in the way
The meek will he guide in judgment:
And the meek will he teach his way
All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth
Unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies
For thy name's sake, O LORD,
Pardon mine iniquity; for it is great
What man is he that feareth the LORD
Him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose
His soul shall dwell at ease;
And his seed shall inherit the earth
The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him;
And he will shew them his covenant
Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD;
For he shall pluck my feet out of the net
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me;
For I am desolate and afflicted
Look upon mine affliction and my pain;
And forgive all my sins
Consider mine enemies; for they are many;
And they hate me with cruel hatred
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me;
For I wait on thee
For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes:
And I have walked in thy truth
I have not sat with vain persons,
Neither will I go in with dissemblers
I have hated the congregation of evil doers;
And will not sit with the wicked
I will wash mine hands in innocency:
So will I compass thine altar, O LORD
Gather not my soul with sinners,
Nor my life with bloody men
In whose hands is mischief,
And their right hand is full of bribes
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity:
Redeem me, and be merciful unto me
My foot standeth in an even place:
In the congregations will I bless the LORD
The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear
The LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid
Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice:
Have mercy also upon me, and answer me
When my father and my mother forsake me,
Then the LORD will take me up
I had fainted,
Unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living
Give them according to their deeds,
And according to the wickedness of their endeavours:
Give them after the work of their hands;
Render to them their desert
Blessed be the LORD,
Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications
The LORD is their strength,
And he is the saving strength of his anointed
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance:
Feed them also, and lift them up for ever
The voice of the LORD is powerful;
The voice of the LORD is full of majesty
The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars;
Yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon
He maketh them also to skip like a calf;
Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn
The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire
The LORD sitteth upon the flood;
Yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever
The LORD will give strength unto his people;
The LORD will bless his people with peace
I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up,
And hast not made my foes to rejoice over me
O LORD my God,
I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me
Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his,
And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved
Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me:
LORD, be thou my helper
To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent
O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever
I have hated them that regard lying vanities:
But I trust in the LORD
And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy:
Thou hast set my feet in a large room
For my life is spent with grief,
And my years with sighing:
My strength faileth because of mine iniquity,
And my bones are consumed
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind:
I am like a broken vessel
My times are in thy hand:
Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant:
Save me for thy mercies' sake
Let the lying lips be put to silence;
Which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous
Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart,
All ye that hope in the LORD
Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven,
Whose sin is covered
Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity,
And in whose spirit there is no guile
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me:
I acknowledged my sin unto thee,
And mine iniquity have I not hid
I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD;
And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin
Many sorrows shall be to the wicked:
But he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about
Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous:
For praise is comely for the upright
Praise the LORD with harp:
Sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings
Sing unto him a new song;
Play skilfully with a loud noise
For the word of the LORD is right;
And all his works are done in truth
He loveth righteousness and judgment:
The earth is full of the goodness of the LORD
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made;
And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap:
He layeth up the depth in storehouses
Let all the earth fear the LORD:
Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him
For he spake, and it was done;
He commanded, and it stood fast
The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought:
He maketh the devices of the people of none effect
The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever,
The thoughts of his heart to all generations
Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD;
And the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance
He fashioneth their hearts alike;
He considereth all their works
An horse is a vain thing for safety:
Neither shall he deliver any by his great strength
To deliver their soul from death,
And to keep them alive in famine
Our soul waiteth for the LORD:
He is our help and our shield
For our heart shall rejoice in him,
Because we have trusted in his holy name
Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us,
According as we hope in thee
I will bless the LORD at all times:
His praise shall continually be in my mouth
My soul shall make her boast in the LORD:
The humble shall hear thereof, and be glad
O magnify the LORD with me,
And let us exalt his name together
I sought the LORD, and he heard me,
And delivered me from all my fears
They looked unto him, and were lightened:
And their faces were not ashamed
The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him,
And delivereth them
O taste and see that the LORD is good:
Blessed is the man that trusteth in him
O fear the LORD, ye his saints:
For there is no want to them that fear him
The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger:
But they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing
Come, ye children, hearken unto me:
I will teach you the fear of the LORD
What man is he that desireth life,
And loveth many days, that he may see good
Depart from evil, and do good;
Seek peace, and pursue it
The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous,
And his ears are open unto their cry
The face of the LORD is against them that do evil,
To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth
The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth,
And delivereth them out of all their troubles
The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart;
And saveth such as be of a contrite spirit
Many are the afflictions of the righteous:
But the LORD delivereth him out of them all
He keepeth all his bones:
Not one of them is broken
The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants:
And none of them that trust in him shall be desolate
Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me:
Fight against them that fight against me
Take hold of shield and buckler,
And stand up for mine help
Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul:
Let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt
Let them be as chaff before the wind:
And let the angel of the LORD chase them
Let their way be dark and slippery:
And let the angel of the LORD persecute them
For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit,
Which without cause they have digged for my soul
And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD:
It shall rejoice in his salvation
They rewarded me evil for good
To the spoiling of my soul
I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother:
I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother
With hypocritical mockers in feasts,
They gnashed upon me with their teeth
I will give thee thanks in the great congregation:
I will praise thee among much people
Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause
And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness
And of thy praise all the day long
The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart,
That there is no fear of God before his eyes
Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens;
And thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds
How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God
Therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;
And thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures
For with thee is the fountain of life:
In thy light shall we see light
O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee;
And thy righteousness to the upright in heart
Let not the foot of pride come against me,
And let not the hand of the wicked remove me
There are the workers of iniquity fallen:
They are cast down, and shall not be able to rise
Fret not thyself because of evildoers,
Neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity
Trust in the LORD, and do good;
So shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed
And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light,
And thy judgment as the noonday
Cease from anger, and forsake wrath:
Fret not thyself in any wise to do evil
For evildoers shall be cut off:
But those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth
For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be:
Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be
But the meek shall inherit the earth;
And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace
The wicked plotteth against the just,
And gnasheth upon him with his teeth
Their sword shall enter into their own heart,
And their bows shall be broken
A little that a righteous man hath is better
Than the riches of many wicked
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken:
But the LORD upholdeth the righteous
The LORD knoweth the days of the upright:
And their inheritance shall be for ever
They shall not be ashamed in the evil time:
And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied
The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again:
But the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth
For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth;
And they that be cursed of him shall be cut off
The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD:
And he delighteth in his way
Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down:
For the LORD upholdeth him with his hand
He is ever merciful, and lendeth;
And his seed is blessed
Depart from evil, and do good;
And dwell for evermore
The righteous shall inherit the land,
And dwell therein for ever
The law of his God is in his heart;
None of his steps shall slide
The wicked watcheth the righteous,
The LORD will not leave him in his hand,
Nor condemn him when he is judged
I have seen the wicked in great power,
And spreading himself like a green bay tree
But the transgressors shall be destroyed together:
The end of the wicked shall be cut off
But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD:
He is their strength in the time of trouble
For thine arrows stick fast in me,
And thy hand presseth me sore
There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;
Neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin
For mine iniquities are gone over mine head:
As an heavy burden they are too heavy for me
My wounds stink and are corrupt
Because of my foolishness
I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly;
I go mourning all the day long
I am feeble and sore broken:
I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart
My heart panteth, my strength faileth me:
As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me
My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore;
And my kinsmen stand afar off
But I, as a deaf man, heard not;
And I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth
Thus I was as a man that heareth not,
And in whose mouth are no reproofs
For I will declare mine iniquity;
I will be sorry for my sin
But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong:
And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied
They also that render evil for good
Are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is
My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned:
Then spake I with my tongue
And now, Lord, what wait I for
My hope is in thee
Deliver me from all my transgressions:
Make me not the reproach of the foolish
I was dumb, I opened not my mouth;
Because thou didst it
Remove thy stroke away from me:
I am consumed by the blow of thine hand
When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity,
Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth:
Surely every man is vanity
I waited patiently for the LORD;
And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry
And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even
praise unto our God:
Many shall see it, and fear,
And shall trust in the LORD
Many, O LORD my God,
Are thy wonderful works which thou hast done,
And thy thoughts which are to us-ward:
If I would declare and speak of them,
They are more than can be numbered
Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire;
Mine ears hast thou opened:
Burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required
I delight to do thy will, O my God:
Yea, thy law is within my heart
Let them be ashamed and confounded together
That seek after my soul to destroy it;
Let them be driven backward
and put to shame that wish me evil
The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth:
And thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies
The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing:
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:
When shall I come and appear before God
Why art thou cast down, O my soul
And why art thou disquieted in me
Hope thou in God:
For I shall yet praise him For the help of his countenance
Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts:
All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me
As with a sword in my bones,
While they say daily unto me,
Why art thou cast down, O my soul
And why art thou disquieted within me
Hope thou in God;
For I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God
O send out thy light and thy truth: Let them lead me;
Let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles
How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them;
How thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out
Through thee will we push down our enemies:
Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us
For I will not trust in my bow,
Neither shall my sword save me
But thou hast saved us from our enemies,
And hast put them to shame that hated us
In God we boast all the day long,
And praise thy name for ever
But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame;
And goest not forth with our armies
Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy:
And they which hate us spoil for themselves
Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat;
And hast scattered us among the heathen
Thou sellest thy people for nought,
And dost not increase thy wealth by their price
Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours,
A scorn and a derision to them that are round about us
Thou makest us a byword among the heathen,
A shaking of the head among the people
My confusion is continually before me,
And the shame of my face hath covered me
For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth;
By reason of the enemy and avenger
All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant
Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons,
And covered us with the shadow of death
Shall not God search this out
For he knoweth the secrets of the heart
Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long;
We are counted as sheep for the slaughter
Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord
Arise, cast us not off for ever
Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
And forgettest our affliction and our oppression
For our soul is bowed down to the dust:
Our belly cleaveth unto the earth
Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty,
With thy glory and thy majesty
Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;
Whereby the people fall under thee
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
The sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre
All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia,
Out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift;
Even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour
The king's daughter is all glorious within:
Her clothing is of wrought gold
With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought:
They shall enter into the king's palace
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children,
Whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
Therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever
God is our refuge and strength,
A very present help in trouble
Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,
Though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof
There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God,
The holy place of the tabernacles of the most High
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved:
God shall help her, and that right early
The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved:
He uttered his voice, the earth melted
The LORD of hosts is with us;
The God of Jacob is our refuge
Be still, and know that I am God:
I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth
The LORD of hosts is with us;
The God of Jacob is our refuge
For the LORD most high is terrible;
He is a great King over all the earth
He shall subdue the people under us,
And the nations under our feet
God is gone up with a shout,
The LORD with the sound of a trumpet
Sing praises to God, sing praises:
Sing praises unto our King, sing praises
For God is the King of all the earth:
Sing ye praises with understanding
God reigneth over the heathen:
God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised
In the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness
God is known in her palaces for a refuge
For, lo, the kings were assembled,
They passed by together
We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God,
In the midst of thy temple
Let mount Zion rejoice,
Let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments
Walk about Zion, and go round about her:
Tell the towers thereof
My mouth shall speak of wisdom;
I will incline mine ear to a parable:
I will open my dark saying upon the harp
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,
When the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about
They that trust in their wealth,
And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches
For he seeth that wise men die,
Likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others
Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not:
He is like the beasts that perish
This their way is their folly:
Yet their posterity approve their sayings
For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away:
His glory shall not descend after him
He shall go to the generation of his fathers;
They shall never see light
He shall call to the heavens from above,
And to the earth, that he may judge his people
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness:
For God is judge himself
I will take no bullock out of thy house,
Nor he goats out of thy folds
I know all the fowls of the mountains:
And the wild beasts of the field are mine
If I were hungry, I would not tell thee:
For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof
Will I eat the flesh of bulls,
Or drink the blood of goats
Offer unto God thanksgiving;
And pay thy vows unto the most High
Seeing thou hatest instruction,
And castest my words behind thee
Thou givest thy mouth to evil,
And thy tongue frameth deceit
Now consider this, ye that forget God,
Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver
Wash me throughly from mine iniquity,
And cleanse me from my sin
Make me to hear joy and gladness;
That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice
Hide thy face from my sins,
And blot out all mine iniquities
Cast me not away from thy presence;
And take not thy holy spirit from me
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation;
And uphold me with thy free spirit
Then will I teach transgressors thy ways;
And sinners shall be converted unto thee
For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it:
Thou delightest not in burnt offering
Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion:
Build thou the walls of Jerusalem
Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man
The goodness of God endureth continually
Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs;
Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully
The righteous also shall see, and fear,
And shall laugh at him
But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God:
I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever
The fool hath said in his heart,
Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity:
There is none that doeth good
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men,
To see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God
Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy;
There is none that doeth good, no, not one
There were they in great fear, where no fear was:
For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee:
Thou hast put them to shame,
because God hath despised them
When God bringeth back the captivity of his people,
Jacob shall rejoice,
And Israel shall be glad
Hear my prayer, O God;
Give ear to the words of my mouth
Behold, God is mine helper:
The Lord is with them that uphold my soul
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies:
Cut them off in thy truth
Give ear to my prayer, O God;
And hide not thyself from my supplication
Attend unto me, and hear me:
I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise
Because of the voice of the enemy,
Because of the oppression of the wicked:
For they cast iniquity upon me,
And in wrath they hate me
My heart is sore pained within me:
And the terrors of death are fallen upon me
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me,
And horror hath overwhelmed me
And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove
For then would I fly away, and be at rest
I would hasten my escape
Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues:
For I have seen violence and strife in the city
Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
Mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it
We took sweet counsel together,
And walked unto the house of God in company
As for me, I will call upon God;
And the LORD shall save me
He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
For there were many with me
He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him:
He hath broken his covenant
But thou,
O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction:
Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days;
But I will trust in thee
Mine enemies would daily swallow me up:
For they be many that fight against me, O thou most High
What time I am afraid,
I will trust in thee
Every day they wrest my words:
All their thoughts are against me for evil
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves,
They mark my steps, when they wait for my soul
Shall they escape by iniquity
In thine anger cast down the people, O God
When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back:
This I know; for God is for me
In God will I praise his word:
In the LORD will I praise his word
In God have I put my trust:
I will not be afraid what man can do unto me
Thy vows are upon me, O God:
I will render praises unto thee
I will cry unto God most high;
Unto God that performeth all things for me
He shall send from heaven, and save me
From the reproach of him that would swallow me up
God shall send forth his mercy and his truth
My soul is among lions:
And I lie even among them that are set on fire,
Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens;
Let thy glory be above all the earth
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed:
I will sing and give praise
I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people:
I will sing unto thee among the nations
For thy mercy is great unto the heavens,
And thy truth unto the clouds
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens:
Let thy glory be above all the earth
Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation
Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men
Yea, in heart ye work wickedness;
Ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth
The wicked are estranged from the womb:
They go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent:
They are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear
Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers,
Charming never so wisely
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance:
He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
And save me from bloody men
They return at evening:
They make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city
Because of his strength will I wait upon thee:
For God is my defence
For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride:
And for cursing and lying which they speak
And at evening let them return;
And let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city
Let them wander up and down for meat,
And grudge if they be not satisfied
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing:
For God is my defence, and the God of my mercy
Thou hast shewed thy people hard things:
Thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment
Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee,
That it may be displayed because of the truth
That thy beloved may be delivered;
Save with thy right hand, and hear me
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem,
And mete out the valley of Succoth
Who will bring me into the strong city
Who will lead me into Edom
Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off
And thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies
Give us help from trouble:
For vain is the help of man
Through God we shall do valiantly:
For he it is that shall tread down our enemies
Hear my cry, O God;
Attend unto my prayer
I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever:
I will trust in the covert of thy wings
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows:
Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name
Thou wilt prolong the king's life:
And his years as many generations
So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever,
That I may daily perform my vows
Truly my soul waiteth upon God:
From him cometh my salvation
My soul, wait thou only upon God;
For my expectation is from him
Trust in him at all times; ye people,
Pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us
God hath spoken once; Twice have I heard this;
That power belongeth unto God
Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy:
For thou renderest to every man according to his work
O God, thou art
My God; early will I seek thee:
My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee
In a dry and thirsty land, where no water is
To see thy power and thy glory,
So as I have seen thee in the sanctuary
Because thy lovingkindness
Is better than life,
My lips shall praise thee
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness;
And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips
When I remember thee upon my bed,
And meditate on thee in the night watches
Because thou hast been my help,
Therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice
But those that seek my soul, to destroy it,
Shall go into the lower parts of the earth
Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer:
Preserve my life from fear of the enemy
Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked;
From the insurrection of the workers of iniquity
That they may shoot in secret at the perfect:
Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not
But God shall shoot at them
With an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded
So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:
All that see them shall flee away
And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God;
For they shall wisely consider of his doing
The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him;
And all the upright in heart shall glory
Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion:
And unto thee shall the vow be performed
O thou that hearest prayer,
Unto thee shall all flesh come
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee,
That he may dwell in thy courts: We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple
Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains;
Being girded with power
Which stilleth the noise of the seas,
the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people
Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: Thou settlest the furrows thereof:
Thou makest it soft with showers: Thou blessest the springing thereof
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness;
And thy paths drop fatness
They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness:
And the little hills rejoice on every side
Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands
Sing forth the honour of his name: Make his praise glorious
Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works
Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee
Come and see the works of God:
He is terrible in his doing toward the children of men
O bless our God, ye people,
And make the voice of his praise to be heard
Which holdeth our soul in life,
And suffereth not our feet to be moved
Thou broughtest us into the net;
Thou laidst affliction upon our loins
I will go into thy house with burnt offerings:
I will pay thee my vows
Come and hear, all ye that fear God,
And I will declare what he hath done for my soul
I cried unto him with my mouth,
And he was extolled with my tongue
If I regard iniquity in my heart,
The Lord will not hear me
But verily God hath heard me;
He hath attended to the voice of my prayer
Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer,
Nor his mercy from me
That thy way may be known upon earth,
Thy saving health among all nations
Let the people praise thee, O God;
Let all the people praise thee
Let the people praise thee, O God;
Let all the people praise thee
Then shall the earth yield her increase;
And God, even our own God, shall bless us
God shall bless us;
And all the ends of the earth shall fear him
Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered:
Let them also that hate him flee before him
But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God:
Yea, let them exceedingly rejoice
Sing unto God,
Sing praises to his name:
Extol him that rideth upon the heavens
By his name JAH, and rejoice before him
O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people,
When thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah
The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God:
Even Sinai itself was moved
At the presence of God, the God of Israel
Kings of armies did flee apace:
And she that tarried at home divided the spoil
When the Almighty scattered kings in it,
It was white as snow in Salmon
The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan;
An high hill as the hill of Bashan
Why leap ye, ye high hills
This is the hill which God desireth to dwell in;
Yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever
He that is our God is the God of salvation;
And unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death
But God shall wound the head of his enemies,
And the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies,
They have seen thy goings, O God;
Even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary
The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after;
Among them were the damsels playing with timbrels
Thy God hath commanded thy strength:
Strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us
Because of thy temple at Jerusalem
Shall kings bring presents unto thee
Rebuke the company of spearmen,
The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people,
Till every one submit himself with pieces of silver:
Scatter thou the people that delight in war
Princes shall come out of Egypt;
Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God
Ascribe ye strength unto God: His excellency is over Israel,
And his strength is in the clouds
O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places:
The God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people
Blessed be God
I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried:
Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head:
They that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty:
Then I restored that which I took not away
Because for thy sake I have borne reproach;
Shame hath covered my face
I am become a stranger unto my brethren,
And an alien unto my mother's children
For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up;
And the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me
They that sit in the gate speak against me;
And I was the song of the drunkards
Is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time:
O God, in the multitude of thy mercy
Hear me, in the truth of thy salvation
Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it:
Deliver me because of mine enemies
Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
Mine adversaries are all before thee
They gave me also gall for my meat;
And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink
Pour out thine indignation upon them,
And let thy wrathful anger take hold of them
Let their habitation be desolate;
And let none dwell in their tents
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten;
And they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded
Add iniquity unto their iniquity:
And let them not come into thy righteousness
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,
And not be written with the righteous
But I am poor and sorrowful:
Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high
I will praise the name of God with a song,
And will magnify him with thanksgiving
This also shall please the LORD
Better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs
For the LORD heareth the poor,
And despiseth not his prisoners
Let the heaven and earth praise him,
The seas, and every thing that moveth therein
The seed also of his servants shall inherit it:
And they that love his name shall dwell therein
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked,
Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man
I am as a wonder unto many;
But thou art my strong refuge
Let my mouth be filled with thy praise
And with thy honour all the day
For mine enemies speak against me;
And they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together
Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul;
Let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt
But I will hope continually,
And will yet praise thee more and more
My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day;
For I know not the numbers thereof
I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD:
I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only
O God, thou hast taught me from my youth:
And hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works
Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again,
And shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth
Thou shalt increase my greatness,
And comfort me on every side
My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee;
And my soul, which thou hast redeemed
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long:
For they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt
Give the king thy judgments, O God,
And thy righteousness unto the king's son
He shall judge thy people with righteousness,
And thy poor with judgment
They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
Throughout all generations
In his days shall the righteous flourish;
And abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,
And from the river unto the ends of the earth
They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him;
And his enemies shall lick the dust
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:
The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts
Yea, all kings shall fall down before him:
All nations shall serve him
For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth;
The poor also, and him that hath no helper
He shall spare the poor and needy,
And shall save the souls of the needy
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel,
Who only doeth wondrous things
Truly God is good to Israel,
Even to such as are of a clean heart
For I was envious at the foolish,
When I saw the prosperity of the wicked
For there are no bands in their death:
But their strength is firm
They are not in trouble as other men;
Neither are they plagued like other men
Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain;
Violence covereth them as a garment
They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression:
They speak loftily
They set their mouth against the heavens,
And their tongue walketh through the earth
Therefore his people return hither:
And waters of a full cup are wrung out to them
Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency
For all the day long have I been plagued,
And chastened every morning
If I say, I will speak thus;
Behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children
Until I went into the sanctuary of God;
Then understood I their end
Surely thou didst set them in slippery places:
Thou castedst them down into destruction
How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment
They are utterly consumed with terrors
So foolish was I, and ignorant:
I was as a beast before thee
Nevertheless I am continually with thee:
Thou hast holden me by my right hand
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel,
And afterward receive me to glory
Whom have I in heaven but thee
And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee
For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish:
Thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee
O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever
Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture
Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old;
The rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed;
This mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt
Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations;
They set up their ensigns for signs
A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees
We see not our signs: There is no more any prophet:
Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long
O God, how long shall the adversary reproach
Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever
Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand
Pluck it out of thy bosom
For God is my King of old,
Working salvation in the midst of the earth
Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength:
Thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters
Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces,
And gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness
Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood:
Thou driedst up mighty rivers
The day is thine, the night also is thine:
Thou hast prepared the light and the sun
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth:
Thou hast made summer and winter
Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD,
And that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name
O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked:
Forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever
Have respect unto the covenant:
For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty
O let not the oppressed return ashamed:
Let the poor and needy praise thy name
Arise, O God, plead thine own cause:
Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily
Forget not the voice of thine enemies:
The tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually
Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks,
Unto thee do we give thanks:
For that thy name is near
Thy wondrous works declare
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved:
I bear up the pillars of it
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
Nor from the south
But God is the judge:
He putteth down one, and setteth up another
All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off;
But the horns of the righteous shall be exalted
In Judah is God known:
His name is great in Israel
In Salem also is his tabernacle,
And his dwelling place in Zion
There brake he the arrows of the bow,
The shield, and the sword, and the battle
Thou art more glorious and excellent
Than the mountains of prey
The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep:
And none of the men of might have found their hands
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob,
Both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep
Thou, even thou, art to be feared:
And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry
Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: Let all that be round about him
Bring presents unto him that ought to be feared
He shall cut off the spirit of princes:
He is terrible to the kings of the earth
I Cried unto God with my voice,
Even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me
Thou holdest mine eyes waking:
I am so troubled that I cannot speak
I have considered the days of old,
The years of ancient times
I call to remembrance my song in the night:
I commune with mine own heart: And my spirit made diligent search
Will the Lord cast off for ever
And will he be favourable no more
Is his mercy clean gone for ever
Doth his promise fail for evermore
Hath God forgotten to be gracious
Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies
I will meditate also of all thy work,
And talk of thy doings
Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary:
Who is so great a God as our God
Thou art the God that doest wonders:
Thou hast declared thy strength among the people
Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people,
The sons of Jacob and Joseph
The clouds poured out water: The skies sent out a sound:
Thine arrows also went abroad
Thou leddest thy people like a flock
By the hand of Moses and Aaron
Give ear, O my people, to my law:
Incline your ears to the words of my mouth
Which we have heard and known,
And our fathers have told us
The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows,
Turned back in the day of battle
And forgat his works,
And his wonders that he had shewed them
Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt,
In the field of Zoan
He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through;
And he made the waters to stand as an heap
And they sinned yet more against him
By provoking the most High in the wilderness
And they tempted God in their heart
By asking meat for their lust
Yea, they spake against God;
They said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness
Because they believed not in God,
And trusted not in his salvation
Though he had commanded the clouds from above,
And opened the doors of heaven
Man did eat angels' food:
He sent them meat to the full
He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven:
And by his power he brought in the south wind
He rained flesh also upon them as dust,
And feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea
And he let it fall in the midst of their camp,
Round about their habitations
The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
And smote down the chosen men of Israel
For all this they sinned still,
And believed not for his wondrous works
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity,
And their years in trouble
When he slew them, then they sought him:
And they returned and enquired early after God
And they remembered that God was their rock,
And the high God their redeemer
Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth,
And they lied unto him with their tongues
For their heart was not right with him,
Neither were they stedfast in his covenant
But he, being full of compassion,
Forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not:
Yea, many a time turned he his anger away,
And did not stir up all his wrath
For he remembered that they were but flesh;
A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again
How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness,
And grieve him in the desert
Yea, they turned back and tempted God,
And limited the Holy One of Israel
How he had wrought his signs in Egypt,
And his wonders in the field of Zoan
He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
And frogs, which destroyed them
He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller,
And their labour unto the locust
He destroyed their vines with hail,
And their sycomore trees with frost
He gave up their cattle also to the hail,
And their flocks to hot thunderbolts
And smote all the firstborn in Egypt;
The chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham
But made his own people to go forth like sheep,
And guided them in the wilderness like a flock
And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,
Even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased
Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God,
And kept not his testimonies
But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
They were turned aside like a deceitful bow
For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
And moved him to jealousy with their graven images
When God heard this, he was wroth,
And greatly abhorred Israel
So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,
The tent which he placed among men
He gave his people over also unto the sword;
And was wroth with his inheritance
The fire consumed their young men;
And their maidens were not given to marriage
Their priests fell by the sword;
And their widows made no lamentation
Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,
And like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine
And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts:
He put them to a perpetual reproach
Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph,
And chose not the tribe of Ephraim
But chose the tribe of Judah,
The mount Zion which he loved
And he built his sanctuary like high palaces,
Like the earth which he hath established for ever
He chose David also his servant,
And took him from the sheepfolds
So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart;
And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands
O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance;
Thy holy temple have they defiled; They have laid Jerusalem on heaps
Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
And there was none to bury them
We are become a reproach to our neighbours,
A scorn and derision to them that are round about us
Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee,
And upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name
For they have devoured Jacob,
And laid waste his dwelling place
O remember not against us former iniquities: Let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us:
For we are brought very low
Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee;
According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die
And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom
Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
And come and save us
Turn us again, O God,
And cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved
O LORD God of hosts,
How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears;
And givest them tears to drink in great measure
Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours:
And our enemies laugh among themselves
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt:
Thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it
She sent out her boughs unto the sea,
And her branches unto the river
Why hast thou then broken down her hedges,
So that all they which pass by the way do pluck her
And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted,
And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself
It is burned with fire, it is cut down:
They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand,
Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself
Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts,
Cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved
Sing aloud unto God our strength:
Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob
For this was a statute for Israel,
And a law of the God of Jacob
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony,
When he went out through the land of Egypt:
Where I heard a language that I understood not
I removed his shoulder from the burden:
His hands were delivered from the pots
Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee:
O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me
There shall no strange god be in thee;
Neither shalt thou worship any strange god
But my people would not hearken to my voice;
And Israel would none of me
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust:
And they walked in their own counsels
I should soon have subdued their enemies,
And turned my hand against their adversaries
The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him:
But their time should have endured for ever
God standeth in the congregation of the mighty;
He judgeth among the gods
Defend the poor and fatherless:
Do justice to the afflicted and needy
Arise, O God, judge the earth:
For thou shalt inherit all nations
For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult:
And they that hate thee have lifted up the head
They have taken crafty counsel against thy people,
And consulted against thy hidden ones
For they have consulted together with one consent:
They are confederate against thee
Which perished at Endor:
They became as dung for the earth
Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb:
Yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna
Who said, Let us take to ourselves
As the fire burneth a wood,
And as the flame setteth the mountains on fire
So persecute them with thy tempest,
And make them afraid with thy storm
Fill their faces with shame;
That they may seek thy name, O LORD
Let them be confounded and troubled for ever;
Yea, let them be put to shame, and perish
Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young,
Even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house:
They will be still praising thee
Blessed is the man whose strength is
in thee; In whose heart are the ways of them
Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well;
The rain also filleth the pools
They go from strength to strength,
Every one of them in Zion appeareth before God
O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer:
Give ear, O God of Jacob
Behold, O God our shield,
And look upon the face of thine anointed
LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land:
Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people,
Thou hast covered all their sin
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever
Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations
Wilt thou not revive us again:
That thy people may rejoice in thee
Shew us thy mercy, O LORD,
And grant us thy salvation
Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him;
That glory may dwell in our land
Mercy and truth are met together;
Righteousness and peace have kissed each other
Truth shall spring out of the earth;
And righteousness shall look down from heaven
Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good;
And our land shall yield her increase
Righteousness shall go before him;
And shall set us in the way of his steps
Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me:
For I am poor and needy
For I cry unto thee daily
Rejoice the soul of thy servant:
For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul
Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer;
And attend to the voice of my supplications
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord;
Neither are there any works like unto thy works
All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord;
And shall glorify thy name
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things:
Thou art God alone
For great is thy mercy toward me:
And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell
His foundation is in the holy mountains
The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people,
That this man was born there
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee
For my soul is full of troubles:
And my life draweth nigh unto the grave
I am counted with them that go down into the pit:
I am as a man that hath no strength
Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave,
Whom thou rememberest no more: And they are cut off from thy hand
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit,
In darkness, in the deeps
Thy wrath lieth hard upon me,
And thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves
Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead
Shall the dead arise and praise thee
Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave
Or thy faithfulness in destruction
Shall thy wonders be known in the dark
And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness
Why hidest thou thy face from me
I am afflicted and ready to die
From my youth up: While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted
Thy fierce wrath goeth over me;
Thy terrors have cut me off
They came round about me daily like water;
They compassed me about together
Lover and friend hast thou put far from me,
And mine acquaintance into darkness
I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever:
With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations
I have made a covenant with my chosen,
I have sworn unto David my servant
Thy seed will I establish for ever,
And build up thy throne to all generations
Thou rulest the raging of the sea:
When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine:
As for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them
The north and the south thou hast created them:
Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name
Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne:
Mercy and truth shall go before thy face
Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound:
They shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance
For the LORD is our defence;
And the Holy One of Israel is our King
I have found David my servant;
With my holy oil have I anointed him
With whom my hand shall be established:
Mine arm also shall strengthen him
The enemy shall not exact upon him;
Nor the son of wickedness afflict him
And I will beat down his foes before his face,
And plague them that hate him
I will set his hand also in the sea,
And his right hand in the rivers
He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father,
My God, and the rock of my salvation
Also I will make him my firstborn,
Higher than the kings of the earth
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore,
And my covenant shall stand fast with him
His seed also will I make to endure for ever,
And his throne as the days of heaven
If his children forsake my law,
And walk not in my judgments
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments
Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,
Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail
His seed shall endure for ever,
And his throne as the sun before me
It shall be established for ever as the moon,
And as a faithful witness in heaven
But thou hast cast off and abhorred,
Thou hast been wroth with thine anointed
Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant:
Thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground
Thou hast broken down all his hedges;
Thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin
All that pass by the way spoil him:
He is a reproach to his neighbours
Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries;
Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice
Thou hast made his glory to cease,
And cast his throne down to the ground
The days of his youth hast thou shortened:
Thou hast covered him with shame
How long, LORD
wilt thou hide thyself for ever
Shall thy wrath burn like fire
Remember how short my time is:
Wherefore hast thou made all men in vain
Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD;
Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday
When it is past, and as a watch in the night
In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;
For we are consumed by thine anger,
And by thy wrath are we troubled
For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:
We spend our years as a tale that is told
Who knoweth the power of thine anger
Even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath
So teach us to number our days,
That we may apply our hearts unto wisdom
Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us,
And the years wherein we have seen evil
Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
And thy glory unto their children
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty
Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
And from the noisome pestilence
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night;
Nor for the arrow that flieth by day
Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness;
Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand;
But it shall not come nigh thee
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold
And see the reward of the wicked
Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge,
Even the most High, thy habitation
There shall no evil befall thee,
Neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
They shall bear thee up in their hands,
Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder:
The young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him:
I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him
With long life will I satisfy him,
To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning,
And thy faithfulness every night
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery;
Upon the harp with a solemn sound
For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work:
I will triumph in the works of thy hands
O LORD, how great are thy works
And thy thoughts are very deep
A brutish man knoweth not;
Neither doth a fool understand this
When the wicked spring as the grass,
And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;
It is that they shall be destroyed for ever
But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn:
I shall be anointed with fresh oil
Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies,
And mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me
Those that be planted in the house of the LORD
Shall flourish in the courts of our God
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;
They shall be fat and flourishing
To shew that the LORD is upright: He is my rock,
And there is no unrighteousness in him
Thy throne is established of old:
Thou art from everlasting
Thy testimonies are very sure:
Holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever
Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth:
Render a reward to the proud
How long shall they utter and speak hard things
And all the workers of iniquity boast themselves
They break in pieces thy people, O LORD,
And afflict thine heritage
They slay the widow and the stranger,
And murder the fatherless
Understand, ye brutish among the people:
And ye fools, when will ye be wise
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear
He that formed the eye, shall he not see
He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct
He that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know
The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man,
That they are vanity
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD,
And teachest him out of thy law
That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
Until the pit be digged for the wicked
For the LORD will not cast off his people,
Neither will he forsake his inheritance
But judgment shall return unto righteousness:
And all the upright in heart shall follow it
Unless the LORD had been my help,
My soul had almost dwelt in silence
In the multitude of my thoughts within me
Thy comforts delight my soul
They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
And condemn the innocent blood
But the LORD is my defence;
And my God is the rock of my refuge
O come, let us sing unto the LORD:
Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving,
And make a joyful noise unto him with psalms
For the LORD is a great God,
And a great King above all gods
In his hand are the deep places of the earth:
The strength of the hills is his also
The sea is his, and he made it:
And his hands formed the dry land
O come, let us worship and bow down:
Let us kneel before the LORD our maker
Harden not your heart,
As in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness
When your fathers tempted me,
Proved me, and saw my work
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation,
And said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways
O Sing unto the LORD a new song:
Sing unto the LORD, all the earth
Sing unto the LORD, bless his name;
Shew forth his salvation from day to day
Declare his glory among the heathen,
His wonders among all people
For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised:
He is to be feared above all gods
For all the gods of the nations are idols:
But the LORD made the heavens
Honour and majesty are before him:
Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary
O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness:
Fear before him, all the earth
The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice;
Let the multitude of isles be glad thereof
Clouds and darkness are round about him:
Righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne
His lightnings enlightened the world:
The earth saw, and trembled
The heavens declare his righteousness,
And all the people see his glory
For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth:
Thou art exalted far above all gods
Light is sown for the righteous,
And gladness for the upright in heart
Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous;
And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness
The LORD hath made known his salvation:
His righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen
He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel:
All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth:
Make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise
Sing unto the LORD with the harp;
With the harp, and the voice of a psalm
With trumpets and sound of cornet
Make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
The world, and they that dwell therein
The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble:
He sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved
Let them praise thy great and terrible name;
For it is holy
Exalt ye the LORD our God,
And worship at his footstool; For he is holy
He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar:
They kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And into his courts with praise:
Be thankful unto him, and bless his name
For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting;
And his truth endureth to all generations
I will sing of mercy and judgment:
Unto thee, O LORD, will I sing
A froward heart shall depart from me:
I will not know a wicked person
He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house:
He that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight
I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; That I may cut off
All wicked doers from the city of the LORD
Hear my prayer, O LORD,
And let my cry come unto thee
For my days are consumed like smoke,
And my bones are burned as an hearth
My heart is smitten, and withered like grass;
So that I forget to eat my bread
Mine enemies reproach me all the day;
And they that are mad against me are sworn against me
For I have eaten ashes like bread,
And mingled my drink with weeping
My days are like a shadow that declineth;
And I am withered like grass
For thy servants take pleasure in her stones,
And favour the dust thereof
So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD,
And all the kings of the earth thy glory
When the LORD shall build up Zion,
He shall appear in his glory
He will regard the prayer of the destitute,
And not despise their prayer
This shall be written for the generation to come:
And the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD
For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary;
From heaven did the LORD behold the earth
To hear the groaning of the prisoner;
To loose those that are appointed to death
To declare the name of the LORD in Zion,
And his praise in Jerusalem
He weakened my strength in the way;
He shortened my days
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure:
Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment;
As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed
The children of thy servants shall continue,
And their seed shall be established before thee
Bless the LORD, O my soul:
And all that is within me, bless his holy name
Bless the LORD, O my soul,
And forget not all his benefits
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;
Who healeth all thy diseases
Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;
Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies
The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment
For all that are oppressed
He made known his ways unto Moses,
His acts unto the children of Israel
The LORD is merciful and gracious,
Slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy
He will not always chide:
Neither will he keep his anger for ever
He hath not dealt with us after our sins;
Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities
For as the heaven is high above the earth,
So great is his mercy toward them that fear him
As far as the east is from the west,
So far hath he removed our transgressions from us
Like as a father pitieth his children,
So the LORD pitieth them that fear him
For he knoweth our frame;
He remembereth that we are dust
As for man, his days are as grass:
As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth
For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
And the place thereof shall know it no more
To such as keep his covenant,
And to those that remember his commandments to do them
The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens;
And his kingdom ruleth over all
Who maketh his angels spirits;
His ministers a flaming fire
Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment:
The waters stood above the mountains
At thy rebuke they fled;
At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away
They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys
Unto the place which thou hast founded for them
By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
Which sing among the branches
Where the birds make their nests:
As for the stork, the fir trees are her house
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats;
And the rocks for the conies
He appointed the moon for seasons:
The sun knoweth his going down
Thou makest darkness, and it is night:
Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth
The young lions roar after their prey,
And seek their meat from God
Man goeth forth unto his work
And to his labour until the evening
So is this great and wide sea,
Wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts
There go the ships: There is that leviathan,
Whom thou hast made to play therein
These wait all upon thee;
That thou mayest give them their meat in due season
That thou givest them they gather:
Thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good
Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created:
And thou renewest the face of the earth
The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever:
The LORD shall rejoice in his works
I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live:
I will sing praise to my God while I have my being
My meditation of him shall be sweet:
I will be glad in the LORD
Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him:
Talk ye of all his wondrous works
Glory ye in his holy name:
Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD
Seek the LORD, and his strength:
Seek his face evermore
Remember his marvellous works that he hath done;
His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth
O ye seed of Abraham his servant,
Ye children of Jacob his chosen
He is the LORD our God:
His judgments are in all the earth
He hath remembered his covenant for ever,
The word which he commanded to a thousand generations
Which covenant he made with Abraham,
And his oath unto Isaac
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law,
And to Israel for an everlasting covenant
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
The lot of your inheritance
When they went from one nation to another,
From one kingdom to another people
He suffered no man to do them wrong:
Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes
Saying, Touch not mine anointed,
Moreover he called for a famine upon the land:
He brake the whole staff of bread
He sent a man before them,
Even Joseph, who was sold for a servant
Until the time that his word came:
The word of the LORD tried him
The king sent and loosed him;
Even the ruler of the people, and let him go free
To bind his princes at his pleasure;
And teach his senators wisdom
Israel also came into Egypt;
And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham
And he increased his people greatly;
And made them stronger than their enemies
He turned their heart to hate his people,
To deal subtilly with his servants
He sent darkness, and made it dark;
And they rebelled not against his word
He turned their waters into blood,
And slew their fish
Their land brought forth frogs in abundance,
In the chambers of their kings
He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies,
And lice in all their coasts
He gave them hail for rain,
And flaming fire in their land
He smote their vines also and their fig trees;
And brake the trees of their coasts
He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number
He brought them forth also with silver and gold:
And there was not one feeble person among their tribes
Egypt was glad when they departed:
For the fear of them fell upon them
He spread a cloud for a covering;
And fire to give light in the night
The people asked, and he brought quails,
And satisfied them with the bread of heaven
And gave them the lands of the heathen:
And they inherited the labour of the people
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
For his mercy endureth for ever
Blessed are they that keep judgment,
And he that doeth righteousness at all times
Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people:
O visit me with thy salvation
We have sinned with our fathers,
We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly
Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake,
That he might make his mighty power to be known
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up:
So he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness
And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them,
And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy
And the waters covered their enemies:
There was not one of them left
Then believed they his words;
They sang his praise
They soon forgat his works;
They waited not for his counsel
And he gave them their request;
But sent leanness into their soul
They made a calf in Horeb,
And worshipped the molten image
They forgat God their saviour,
Which had done great things in Egypt
Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
They believed not his word
But murmured in their tents,
And hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD
Therefore he lifted up his hand against them,
To overthrow them in the wilderness
They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor,
And ate the sacrifices of the dead
Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions:
And the plague brake in upon them
Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment:
And so the plague was stayed
And that was counted unto him for righteousness
Unto all generations for evermore
They angered him also at the waters of strife,
So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes
But were mingled among
the heathen, and learned their works
Thus were they defiled with their own works,
And went a whoring with their own inventions
Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,
Insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance
And he gave them into the hand of the heathen;
And they that hated them ruled over them
Their enemies also oppressed them,
And they were brought into subjection under their hand
Nevertheless he regarded their affliction,
When he heard their cry
He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives
O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good:
For his mercy endureth for ever
Let the redeemed of the LORD say so,
Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west,
From the north, and from the south
They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way;
They found no city to dwell in
Hungry and thirsty,
Their soul fainted in them
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
And he delivered them out of their distresses
And he led them forth by the right way,
That they might go to a city of habitation
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
And for his wonderful works to the children of men
For he satisfieth the longing soul,
And filleth the hungry soul with goodness
Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
Being bound in affliction and iron
Because they rebelled against the words of God,
And contemned the counsel of the Most High
Therefore he brought down their heart with labour;
They fell down, and there was none to help
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
And he saved them out of their distresses
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
And brake their bands in sunder
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
And for his wonderful works to the children of men
For he hath broken the gates of brass,
And cut the bars of iron in sunder
Fools because of their transgression,
And because of their iniquities, are afflicted
Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat;
And they draw near unto the gates of death
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble,
And he saveth them out of their distresses
He sent his word, and healed them,
And delivered them from their destructions
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
And for his wonderful works to the children of men
And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
And declare his works with rejoicing
They that go down to the sea in ships,
That do business in great waters
These see the works of the LORD,
And his wonders in the deep
For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
Which lifteth up the waves thereof
They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
Their soul is melted because of trouble
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
And are at their wits' end
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble,
And he bringeth them out of their distresses
He maketh the storm a calm,
So that the waves thereof are still
Then are they glad because they be quiet;
So he bringeth them unto their desired haven
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
And for his wonderful works to the children of men
Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people,
And praise him in the assembly of the elders
He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
And the watersprings into dry ground
A fruitful land into barrenness,
For the wickedness of them that dwell therein
He turneth the wilderness into a standing water,
And dry ground into watersprings
And there he maketh the hungry
To dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation
He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
And suffereth not their cattle to decrease
Again, they are minished and brought low
Through oppression, affliction, and sorrow
He poureth contempt upon princes,
And causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way
Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction,
And maketh him families like a flock
The righteous shall see it, and rejoice:
And all iniquity shall stop her mouth
Whoso is wise, and will observe these things,
Even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD
O God, my heart is fixed;
I will sing and give praise, even with my glory
Awake, psaltery and harp:
I myself will awake early
I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people:
And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations
For thy mercy is great above the heavens:
And thy truth reacheth unto the clouds
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens:
And thy glory above all the earth
That thy beloved may be delivered:
Save with thy right hand, and answer me
God hath spoken in his holiness;
I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth
Who will bring me into the strong city
Who will lead me into Edom
Give us help from trouble:
For vain is the help of man
Through God we shall do valiantly:
For he it is that shall tread down our enemies
Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise
For my love they are my adversaries:
But I give myself unto prayer
And they have rewarded me evil for good,
And hatred for my love
Set thou a wicked man over him:
And let Satan stand at his right hand
When he shall be judged, let him be condemned:
And let his prayer become sin
Let his days be few;
And let another take his office
Let his children be fatherless,
And his wife a widow
Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg:
Let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places
Let the extortioner catch all that he hath;
And let the strangers spoil his labour
Let there be none to extend mercy unto him:
Neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children
Let his posterity be cut off;
And in the generation following let their name be blotted out
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out
Let them be before the LORD continually,
That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth
As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment,
So let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones
Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him,
And for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually
Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD,
And of them that speak evil against my soul
For I am poor and needy,
And my heart is wounded within me
I am gone like the shadow when it declineth:
I am tossed up and down as the locust
My knees are weak through fasting;
And my flesh faileth of fatness
I became also a reproach unto them:
When they looked upon me they shaked their heads
That they may know that this is thy hand;
That thou, LORD, hast done it
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame,
And let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle
I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth;
Yea, I will praise him among the multitude
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor,
To save him from those that condemn his soul
The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion:
Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies
He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies;
He shall wound the heads over many countries
I will praise the LORD with my whole heart,
In the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation
The works of the LORD are great,
Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein
His work is honourable and glorious:
And his righteousness endureth for ever
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered:
The LORD is gracious and full of compassion
He hath given meat unto them that fear him:
He will ever be mindful of his covenant
He hath shewed his people the power of his works,
That he may give them the heritage of the heathen
The works of his hands are verity and judgment;
All his commandments are sure
He sent redemption unto his people:
He hath commanded his covenant for ever:
Holy and reverend is his name
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom:
A good understanding have all they that do his commandments:
His praise endureth for ever
Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
That delighteth greatly in his commandments
His seed shall be mighty upon earth:
The generation of the upright shall be blessed
Wealth and riches shall be in his house:
And his righteousness endureth for ever
Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness:
He is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous
A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth:
He will guide his affairs with discretion
Surely he shall not be moved for ever:
The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings:
His heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD
His heart is established, he shall not be afraid,
Until he see his desire upon his enemies
He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor;
His righteousness endureth for ever;
His horn shall be exalted with honour
The wicked shall see it, and be grieved;
He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away:
The desire of the wicked shall perish
Praise, O ye servants of the LORD,
Praise the name of the LORD
Blessed be the name of the LORD
From this time forth and for evermore
From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same
The LORD's name is to be praised
The LORD is high above all nations,
And his glory above the heavens
Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
And lifteth the needy out of the dunghill
That he may set him with princes,
Even with the princes of his people
He maketh the barren woman to keep house,
And to be a joyful mother of children
When Israel went out of Egypt,
The house of Jacob from a people of strange language
Judah was his sanctuary,
And Israel his dominion
The sea saw it, and fled:
Jordan was driven back
The mountains skipped like rams,
And the little hills like lambs
What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest
Thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams;
And ye little hills, like lambs
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord,
At the presence of the God of Jacob
Which turned the rock into a standing water,
The flint into a fountain of waters
But our God is in the heavens:
He hath done whatsoever he hath pleased
Their idols are silver and gold,
The work of men's hands
They have mouths, but they speak not:
Eyes have they, but they see not
They have ears, but they hear not:
Noses have they, but they smell not
They that make them are like unto them;
So is every one that trusteth in them
O Israel, trust thou in the LORD:
He is their help and their shield
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD:
He is their help and their shield
Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD:
He is their help and their shield
He will bless them that fear
the LORD, both small and great
The LORD shall increase you more and more,
You and your children
Ye are blessed of the LORD
Which made heaven and earth
The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's:
But the earth hath he given to the children of men
The dead praise not the LORD,
Neither any that go down into silence
But we will bless the LORD
From this time forth and for evermore
I love the LORD,
Because he hath heard my voice and my supplications
Because he hath inclined his ear unto me,
Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous;
Yea, our God is merciful
The LORD preserveth the simple:
I was brought low, and he helped me
Return unto thy rest, O my soul;
For the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee
I will walk before
The LORD in the land of the living
What shall I render unto the LORD
For all his benefits toward me
I will take the cup of salvation,
And call upon the name of the LORD
Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints
O LORD, truly I am thy servant;
I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: Thou hast loosed my bonds
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
And will call upon the name of the LORD
I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people
O praise the LORD,
All ye nations: Praise him, all ye people
For his merciful kindness is great toward us:
And the truth of the LORD endureth for ever
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
Because his mercy endureth for ever
The LORD is on my side;
I will not fear: What can man do unto me
The LORD taketh my part with them that help me:
Therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me
They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about:
But in the name of the LORD I will destroy them
They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns:
For in the name of the LORD I will destroy them
Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall:
But the LORD helped me
The LORD is my strength and song,
And is become my salvation
The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous:
The right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly
I shall not die, but live,
And declare the works of the LORD
The LORD hath chastened me sore:
But he hath not given me over unto death
Open to me the gates of righteousness:
I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD
This gate of the LORD,
Into which the righteous shall enter
I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me,
And art become my salvation
The stone which the builders refused
Is become the head stone of the corner
This is the LORD's doing;
It is marvellous in our eyes
This is the day which the LORD hath made;
We will rejoice and be glad in it
Thou art my God, and I will praise thee:
Thou art my God, I will exalt thee
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
For his mercy endureth for ever
Blessed are the undefiled in the way,
Who walk in the law of the LORD
Blessed are they that keep his testimonies,
And that seek him with the whole heart
They also do no iniquity:
They walk in his ways
Thou hast commanded us
To keep thy precepts diligently
Then shall I not be ashamed,
When I have respect unto all thy commandments
I will praise thee with uprightness of heart,
When I shall have learned thy righteous judgments
I will keep thy statutes:
O forsake me not utterly
Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way
By taking heed thereto according to thy word
With my whole heart have I sought thee:
O let me not wander from thy commandments
Thy word have I hid in mine heart,
That I might not sin against thee
Blessed art thou, O LORD:
Teach me thy statutes
I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies,
As much as in all riches
I will meditate in thy precepts,
And have respect unto thy ways
Deal bountifully with thy servant,
That I may live, and keep thy word
I am a stranger in the earth:
Hide not thy commandments from me
Princes also did sit and speak against me:
But thy servant did meditate in thy statutes
Thy testimonies also are
My delight and my counsellors
Make me to understand the way of thy precepts:
So shall I talk of thy wondrous works
My soul melteth for heaviness:
Strengthen thou me according unto thy word
Remove from me the way of lying:
And grant me thy law graciously
I will run the way of thy commandments,
When thou shalt enlarge my heart
Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes;
And I shall keep it unto the end
Make me to go in the path of thy commandments;
For therein do I delight
Incline my heart unto thy testimonies,
And not to covetousness
Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity;
And quicken thou me in thy way
Stablish thy word
Unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear
Behold, I have longed after thy precepts:
Quicken me in thy righteousness
Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD,
Even thy salvation, according to thy word
So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:
For I trust in thy word
And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth;
For I have hoped in thy judgments
So shall I keep
thy law continually for ever and ever
And I will walk at liberty:
For I seek thy precepts
I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings,
And will not be ashamed
And I will delight myself
In thy commandments, which I have loved
Remember the word unto thy servant,
Upon which thou hast caused me to hope
This is my comfort in my affliction:
For thy word hath quickened me
The proud have had me greatly in derision:
Yet have I not declined from thy law
I remembered thy judgments of old,
O LORD; And have comforted myself
Horror hath taken hold upon me
Because of the wicked that forsake thy law
Thy statutes have been my songs
In the house of my pilgrimage
Thou art my portion, O LORD:
I have said that I would keep thy words
I intreated thy favour with my whole heart:
Be merciful unto me according to thy word
I thought on my ways,
And turned my feet unto thy testimonies
I made haste, and delayed not
To keep thy commandments
The bands of the wicked have robbed me:
But I have not forgotten thy law
At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee
Because of thy righteous judgments
I am a companion of all them
That fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts
The earth, O LORD, is full of
Thy mercy: Teach me thy statutes
Thou hast dealt well with thy servant,
O LORD, according unto thy word
Before I was afflicted I went astray:
But now have I kept thy word
The proud have forged a lie against me:
But I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart
Their heart is as fat as grease;
But I delight in thy law
It is good for me that I have been afflicted;
That I might learn thy statutes
The law of thy mouth is better unto me
Than thousands of gold and silver
Thy hands have made me and fashioned me:
Give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments
They that fear thee will be glad when they see me;
Because I have hoped in thy word
Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live:
For thy law is my delight
Let those that fear thee turn unto me,
And those that have known thy testimonies
My soul fainteth for thy salvation:
But I hope in thy word
For I am become like a bottle in the smoke;
Yet do I not forget thy statutes
How many are the days of thy servant
When wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me
The proud have digged pits for me,
Which are not after thy law
All thy commandments are faithful:
They persecute me wrongfully; help thou me
They had almost consumed me upon earth;
But I forsook not thy precepts
Thy faithfulness is unto all generations:
Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth
They continue this day according to thine ordinances:
For all are thy servants
Unless thy law had been my delights,
I should then have perished in mine affliction
I will never forget thy precepts:
For with them thou hast quickened me
I am thine, save me;
For I have sought thy precepts
The wicked have waited for me to destroy me:
But I will consider thy testimonies
I have seen an end of all perfection:
But thy commandment is exceeding broad
O how love I thy law
It is my meditation all the day
Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies:
For they are ever with me
I have more understanding than all my teachers:
For thy testimonies are my meditation
I understand more than the ancients,
Because I keep thy precepts
I have refrained my feet from every evil way,
That I might keep thy word
I have not departed
From thy judgments: For thou hast taught me
How sweet are thy words unto my taste
Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet,
And a light unto my path
I have sworn, and I will perform it,
That I will keep thy righteous judgments
My soul is continually in my hand:
Yet do I not forget thy law
The wicked have laid a snare for me:
Yet I erred not from thy precepts
Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever:
For they are the rejoicing of my heart
I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes
Alway, even unto the end
I hate vain thoughts:
But thy law do I love
Thou art my hiding place and my shield:
I hope in thy word
Depart from me, ye evildoers:
For I will keep the commandments of my God
Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe:
And I will have respect unto thy statutes continually
Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
For their deceit is falsehood
Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
Therefore I love thy testimonies
My flesh trembleth for fear of thee;
And I am afraid of thy judgments
Mine eyes fail for thy salvation,
And for the word of thy righteousness
It is time for thee, LORD, to work:
For they have made void thy law
Therefore I love thy commandments
Above gold; yea, above fine gold
Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right;
And I hate every false way
Thy testimonies are wonderful:
Therefore doth my soul keep them
The entrance of thy words giveth light;
It giveth understanding unto the simple
I opened my mouth, and panted:
For I longed for thy commandments
Order my steps in thy word:
And let not any iniquity have dominion over me
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant;
And teach me thy statutes
Rivers of waters run down mine eyes,
Because they keep not thy law
Righteous art thou, O LORD,
And upright are thy judgments
Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded
are righteous and very faithful
My zeal hath consumed me,
Because mine enemies have forgotten thy words
Thy word is very pure:
Therefore thy servant loveth it
I am small and despised:
Yet do not I forget thy precepts
Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,
And thy law is the truth
Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me:
Yet thy commandments are my delights
The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting:
Give me understanding, and I shall live
I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried:
I hoped in thy word
Mine eyes prevent the night watches,
That I might meditate in thy word
They draw nigh that follow after mischief:
They are far from thy law
Thou art near, O LORD;
And all thy commandments are truth
Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old
That thou hast founded them for ever
Consider mine affliction, and deliver me:
For I do not forget thy law
Plead my cause, and deliver me:
Quicken me according to thy word
Salvation is far from the wicked:
For they seek not thy statutes
Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD:
Quicken me according to thy judgments
Many are my persecutors and mine enemies;
Yet do I not decline from thy testimonies
I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved;
Because they kept not thy word
Thy word is true from the beginning:
And every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever
Princes have persecuted me without a cause:
But my heart standeth in awe of thy word
I rejoice at thy word,
As one that findeth great spoil
I hate and abhor lying:
But thy law do I love
Seven times a day do I praise thee
Because of thy righteous judgments
Great peace have they which love thy law:
And nothing shall offend them
LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation,
And done thy commandments
My soul hath kept thy testimonies;
And I love them exceedingly
I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies:
For all my ways are before thee
Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD:
Give me understanding according to thy word
Let my supplication come before thee:
Deliver me according to thy word
My lips shall utter praise,
When thou hast taught me thy statutes
My tongue shall speak of thy word:
For all thy commandments are righteousness
Let thine hand help me;
For I have chosen thy precepts
I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD;
And thy law is my delight
I have gone astray like a lost sheep;
seek thy servant; For I do not forget thy commandments
In my distress
I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me
Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips,
And from a deceitful tongue
What shall be given unto thee
or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue
Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech,
That I dwell in the tents of Kedar
I am for peace:
But when I speak, they are for war
My help cometh from the LORD,
Which made heaven and earth
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved:
He that keepeth thee will not slumber
The LORD is thy keeper:
The LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand
The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil:
He shall preserve thy soul
The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in
From this time forth, and even for evermore
Jerusalem is builded
As a city that is compact together
For there are set thrones of judgment,
The thrones of the house of David
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
They shall prosper that love thee
Peace be within thy walls,
And prosperity within thy palaces
Because of the house of the LORD our God
I will seek thy good
Behold, as the eyes of servants
Look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress;
So our eyes wait upon the LORD our God,
Until that he have mercy upon us
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease,
And with the contempt of the proud
If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say
Then they had swallowed us up quick,
When their wrath was kindled against us
Then the waters had overwhelmed us,
The stream had gone over our soul
Blessed be the LORD,
Who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth
Our help is in the name of the LORD,
Who made heaven and earth
For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous;
Lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity
When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion,
We were like them that dream
The LORD hath done great things for us;
Whereof we are glad
Turn again our captivity, O LORD,
As the streams in the south
They that sow in tears
Shall reap in joy
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed,
Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him
Except the LORD build the house,
They labour in vain that build it:
Except the LORD keep the city,
The watchman waketh but in vain
Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD:
And the fruit of the womb is his reward
As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man;
So are children of the youth
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them:
They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate
Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD;
That walketh in his ways
The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion:
And thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life
Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children,
And peace upon Israel
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth,
May Israel now say
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth:
Yet they have not prevailed against me
The LORD is righteous:
He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops,
Which withereth afore it groweth up
Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand;
Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom
Let thine ears be attentive
To the voice of my supplications
But there is forgiveness with thee,
That thou mayest be feared
My soul waiteth for the Lord
More than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning
Let Israel hope in the LORD
From henceforth and for ever
How he sware unto the LORD,
And vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob
Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house,
Nor go up into my bed
Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah:
We found it in the fields of the wood
We will go into his tabernacles:
We will worship at his footstool
Arise, O LORD, into thy rest;
Thou, and the ark of thy strength
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness;
And let thy saints shout for joy
The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David;
He will not turn from it;
Of the fruit of thy body
Will I set upon thy throne
For the LORD hath chosen Zion;
He hath desired it for his habitation
I will abundantly bless her provision:
I will satisfy her poor with bread
I will also clothe her priests with salvation:
And her saints shall shout aloud for joy
There will I make the horn of David to bud:
I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed
As the dew of Hermon,
And as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion:
For there the LORD commanded the blessing,
Even life for evermore
Behold, bless ye the LORD,
All ye servants of the LORD,
Which by night stand in the house of the LORD
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary,
And bless the LORD
The LORD that made heaven and earth
Bless thee out of Zion
Praise ye the name of the LORD;
Praise him, O ye servants of the LORD
Ye that stand in the house of the LORD,
In the courts of the house of our God
For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself,
And Israel for his peculiar treasure
For I know that the LORD is great,
And that our Lord is above all gods
Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth,
In the seas, and all deep places
Who smote the firstborn of Egypt,
Both of man and beast
Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan,
And all the kingdoms of Canaan
Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever;
And thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations
For the LORD will judge his people,
And he will repent himself concerning his servants
They have mouths, but they speak not;
Eyes have they, but they see not
They that make them are like unto them:
So is every one that trusteth in them
Bless the LORD, O house of Israel:
Bless the LORD, O house of Aaron
Bless the LORD, O house of Levi:
Ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD
Blessed be the LORD out of Zion,
Which dwelleth at Jerusalem
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
For his mercy endureth for ever
O give thanks unto the God of gods:
For his mercy endureth for ever
O give thanks to the Lord of lords:
For his mercy endureth for ever
To him who alone doeth great wonders:
For his mercy endureth for ever
To him that by wisdom made the heavens:
For his mercy endureth for ever
To him that stretched out the earth above the waters:
For his mercy endureth for ever
To him that made great lights:
For his mercy endureth for ever
The sun to rule by day:
For his mercy endureth for ever
The moon and stars to rule by night:
For his mercy endureth for ever
To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn:
For his mercy endureth for ever
And brought out Israel from among them:
For his mercy endureth for ever
With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm:
For his mercy endureth for ever
To him which divided the Red sea into parts:
For his mercy endureth for ever
And made Israel to pass through the midst of it:
For his mercy endureth for ever
But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea:
For his mercy endureth for ever
To him which led his people through the wilderness:
For his mercy endureth for ever
To him which smote great kings:
For his mercy endureth for ever
And slew famous kings:
For his mercy endureth for ever
Sihon king of the Amorites:
For his mercy endureth for ever
And Og the king of Bashan:
For his mercy endureth for ever
And gave their land for an heritage:
For his mercy endureth for ever
Even an heritage unto Israel his servant:
For his mercy endureth for ever
Who remembered us in our low estate:
For his mercy endureth for ever
And hath redeemed us from our enemies:
For his mercy endureth for ever
Who giveth food to all flesh:
For his mercy endureth for ever
O give thanks unto the God of heaven:
For his mercy endureth for ever
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept,
When we remembered Zion
How shall we sing
The LORD's song in a strange land
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,
Let my right hand forget her cunning
Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
Against the stones
I will praise thee with my whole heart:
Before the gods will I sing praise unto thee
In the day when I cried thou answeredst me,
And strengthenedst me with strength in my soul
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD,
When they hear the words of thy mouth
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD:
For great is the glory of the LORD
O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me
Thou compassest my path and my lying down,
And art acquainted with all my ways
For there is not a word in my tongue,
But, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether
Thou hast beset me behind and before,
And laid thine hand upon me
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
It is high, I cannot attain unto it
Whither shall I go from thy spirit
Or whither shall I flee from thy presence
If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:
If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there
Even there shall thy hand lead me,
And thy right hand shall hold me
For thou hast possessed my reins:
Thou hast covered me in my mother's womb
My substance was not hid from thee,
When I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God
How great is the sum of them
Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God:
Depart from me therefore, ye bloody men
For they speak against thee wickedly,
And thine enemies take thy name in vain
Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee
And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee
I hate them with perfect hatred:
I count them mine enemies
Search me, O God, and know my heart:
Try me, and know my thoughts
Which imagine mischiefs in their heart;
Continually are they gathered together for war
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent;
Adders' poison is under their lips
The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside;
They have set gins for me
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation,
Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle
Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked:
Further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves
As for the head of those that compass me about,
Let the mischief of their own lips cover them
Let burning coals fall upon them:
Let them be cast into the fire; Into deep pits, that they rise not up again
Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth:
Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him
I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
And the right of the poor
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name:
The upright shall dwell in thy presence
LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me;
Give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee
Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense;
And the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice
Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth;
Keep the door of my lips
Let the righteous smite me;
It shall be a kindness: And let him reprove me;
It shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head:
For yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities
When their judges are overthrown in stony places,
They shall hear my words; for they are sweet
Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity
I cried unto the LORD with my voice;
With my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication
I poured out my complaint before him;
I shewed before him my trouble
Attend unto my cry;
For I am brought very low:
Deliver me from my persecutors;
For they are stronger than I
Bring my soul out of prison,
That I may praise thy name:
The righteous shall compass me about;
For thou shalt deal bountifully with me
And enter not into judgment with thy servant:
For in thy sight shall no man living be justified
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works;
I muse on the work of thy hands
I stretch forth my hands unto thee:
My soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land
Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies:
I flee unto thee to hide me
Blessed be the LORD my strength,
Which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight
LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him
Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him
Man is like to vanity:
His days are as a shadow that passeth away
Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down:
Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke
Cast forth lightning, and scatter them:
Shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them
Whose mouth speaketh vanity,
And their right hand is a right hand of falsehood
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God:
Upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee
It is he that giveth salvation unto kings:
Who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword
Happy is that people, that is in such a case:
Yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD
Every day will I bless thee;
And I will praise thy name for ever and ever
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised;
And his greatness is unsearchable
I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty,
And of thy wondrous works
And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts:
And I will declare thy greatness
They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
And shall sing of thy righteousness
The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion;
Slow to anger, and of great mercy
The LORD is good to all:
And his tender mercies are over all his works
All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD;
And thy saints shall bless thee
They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom,
And talk of thy power
The LORD upholdeth all that fall,
And raiseth up all those that be bowed down
The eyes of all wait upon thee;
And thou givest them their meat in due season
Thou openest thine hand,
And satisfiest the desire of every living thing
The LORD is righteous in all his ways,
And holy in all his works
The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him,
To all that call upon him in truth
The LORD preserveth all them that love him:
But all the wicked will he destroy
Praise the LORD, O my soul
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man,
In whom there is no help
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth;
In that very day his thoughts perish
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help,
Whose hope is in the LORD his God
Which executeth judgment for the oppressed:
Which giveth food to the hungry
The LORD looseth the prisoners
The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind:
The LORD raiseth them that are bowed down:
The LORD loveth the righteous
The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion,
Unto all generations
The LORD doth build up Jerusalem:
He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel
He healeth the broken in heart,
And bindeth up their wounds
He telleth the number of the stars;
He calleth them all by their names
Great is our Lord, and of great power:
His understanding is infinite
The LORD lifteth up the meek:
He casteth the wicked down to the ground
Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving;
Sing praise upon the harp unto our God
The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him,
In those that hope in his mercy
Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem;
Praise thy God, O Zion
He maketh peace in thy borders,
And filleth thee with the finest of the wheat
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth:
His word runneth very swiftly
He giveth snow like wool:
He scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes
He casteth forth his ice like morsels:
Who can stand before his cold
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them:
He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow
He sheweth his word unto Jacob,
His statutes and his judgments unto Israel
He hath not dealt so with any nation:
And as for his judgments, they have not known them
Praise ye him, all his angels:
Praise ye him, all his hosts
Praise ye him, sun and moon:
Praise him, all ye stars of light
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens,
And ye waters that be above the heavens
He hath also stablished them for ever and ever:
He hath made a decree which shall not pass
Praise the LORD from the earth,
Ye dragons, and all deeps
Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours;
Stormy wind fulfilling his word
Beasts, and all cattle;
Creeping things, and flying fowl
Kings of the earth, and all people;
Princes, and all judges of the earth
Let them praise the name of the LORD:
For his name alone is excellent;
His glory is above the earth and heaven
He also exalteth the horn of his people,
The praise of all his saints;
Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him
Sing unto the LORD a new song,
And his praise in the congregation of saints
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him:
Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King
Let them praise his name in the dance:
Let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp
For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people:
He will beautify the meek with salvation
Let the saints be joyful in glory:
Let them sing aloud upon their beds
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth,
And a twoedged sword in their hand
To execute vengeance upon the heathen,
And punishments upon the people
To bind their kings with chains,
And their nobles with fetters of iron
To execute upon them the judgment written:
This honour have all his saints
Praise God in his sanctuary:
Praise him in the firmament of his power
Praise him for his mighty acts:
Praise him according to his excellent greatness
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet:
Praise him with the psaltery and harp
Praise him upon the loud cymbals:
Praise him upon the high sounding cymbals
And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons
And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years
And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband
Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread
Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah
The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband
Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept
And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people
Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband
If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons
would ye tarry for them till they were grown
would ye stay for them from having husbands
nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me
And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her
And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law
And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God
When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her
So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem
And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi
And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz
And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace
And she said unto her, Go, my daughter
Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this
And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab
And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore
The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust
Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens
And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar
And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left
and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not
So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley
And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest
And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field
Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee
Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking
And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do
And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do
And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her
And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down
And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet
And he said, Who art thou
And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman
And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman
And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I
Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it
And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city
And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter
And she told her all that the man had done to her
And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law
And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's
Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance
Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel
And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi
Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day
and let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman
So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son
And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel
And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him
And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it
And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David
Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron
and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab
and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon
and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed
and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David
